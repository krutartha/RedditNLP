It claims the vast majority of deaths in the conflict are civilians, and is frequently used to justify claims of genocide against Israel. The current number stands at around 32k Dead, of whom half are minors. \n\nHere's the thing, the number is wrong. I think people directly quoting the number are making a mistake. It's wrong. It's obviously wrong. But, the specific way it's wrong is awkward for everyone. \n\nThe reason why is this. The GMH Talley is accurately tracking confirmed deaths. Most of the people on the list (there's an actual list of names) are dead. It's just undercounting the actual death toll.\n\nIt's awkward for Hamas because: \n\nHamas and \"resistance\" deaths are not being accurately tracked in the page. The list is exclusively composed of people reported to the ministry or who ended up in the hospital. There's basically no evidence Hamas/PIJ is telling the GHM accurate casualty tallies. \n\nSoldier/terrorists lost behind the lines, killed in airstrikes, buried in collapsed tunnels, are not being added to the list. The 7-8k Missing category that the GHM mentions is probably disproportionately fighting age males. \n\nOne of the clearest indicators of this is the fact that terrorists killed during the Oct. 7 offensive do not seem to show up on the list. We know that between 500 and 2000 fighters died in \"67 Israel\" during the offensive, but the early list didn't \"jump\" at the start with fight-age male losses. \n\nThe incentive for \"the Resistance\" is obvious. They plan to claim victory/they fought off Israel after the war ends. It's the same reason they publish their absurdly fake Talley of Israeli casualties and the videos of RPG ambushes that don't show impact. They can't honestly admit to the Palastinian people that 2/3rds of their battalions have been smashed. \n\nIt's awkward for Israel because:\n\nIsrael actually has killed an absolute fuck ton of civilians. The ratio isn't quite as lopsided as the GMH Talley suggests. But 12k dead Palastinian children is a lot. The evidence that they've killed so many people is extremely well documented and the attempts to deny it or claim it's staged are really emberassing lies. \n\nThe thing is, Israel is probably aware of this. They do go around claiming the GMH is false, but they can't actually admit that the real reason why is that it's just incomplete. \n\nTechnically speaking, if Israel actually has killed 10k-15k resistance fighters and 25k-30k civilians, this isn't a *good* Soldier-Civilian death ratio. The US broadly achieved 2:1 in the seige of Mosul, so Israel with 1:1.5 - 1:3 still raises a bunch of uncomfortable questions. But, the fact they can't admit this leaves them open to the GMH charge of something ludicrous like 1:6 or worse. A 1:2 ratio is an exceedingly bloody war, but within defensible bounds. A 1:6 ratio is a much more credible genocide allegation. \n\nConclusion:\n\nWe're left with the Gaza Ministry number because it's the only Talley of the dead that's detailed and data driven. It's not a lie, but it should not be taken as a representative. It's still useful as an absolute floor of deaths.

It's obviously wrong. But, the specific way it's wrong is awkward for everyone. \n\nThe reason why is this. The GMH Talley is accurately tracking confirmed deaths. Most of the people on the list (there's an actual list of names) are dead. It's just undercounting the actual death toll.\n\nIt's awkward for Hamas because: \n\nHamas and \"resistance\" deaths are not being accurately tracked in the page.

There's basically no evidence Hamas/PIJ is telling the GHM accurate casualty tallies. \n\nSoldier/terrorists lost behind the lines, killed in airstrikes, buried in collapsed tunnels, are not being added to the list. The 7-8k Missing category that the GHM mentions is probably disproportionately fighting age males. \n\nOne of the clearest indicators of this is the fact that terrorists killed during the Oct. 7 offensive do not seem to show up on the list. We know that between 500 and 2000 fighters died in \"67 Israel\" during the offensive, but the early list didn't \"jump\" at the start with fight-age male losses. \n\nThe incentive for \"the Resistance\" is obvious. They plan to claim victory/they fought off Israel after the war ends. It's the same reason they publish their absurdly fake Talley of Israeli casualties and the videos of RPG ambushes that don't show impact. They can't honestly admit to the Palastinian people that 2/3rds of their battalions have been smashed. \n\nIt's awkward for Israel because:\n\nIsrael actually has killed an absolute fuck ton of civilians. The ratio isn't quite as lopsided as the GMH Talley suggests. But 12k dead Palastinian children is a lot. The evidence that they've killed so many people is extremely well documented and the attempts to deny it or claim it's staged are really emberassing lies. \n\nThe thing is, Israel is probably aware of this. They do go around claiming the GMH is false, but they can't actually admit that the real reason why is that it's just incomplete. \n\nTechnically speaking, if Israel actually has killed 10k-15k resistance fighters and 25k-30k civilians, this isn't a *good* Soldier-Civilian death ratio. The US broadly achieved 2:1 in the seige of Mosul, so Israel with 1:1.5 - 1:3 still raises a bunch of uncomfortable questions. But, the fact they can't admit this leaves them open to the GMH charge of something ludicrous like 1:6 or worse. A 1:2 ratio is an exceedingly bloody war, but within defensible bounds. A 1:6 ratio is a much more credible genocide allegation. \n\nConclusion:\n\nWe're left with the Gaza Ministry number because it's the only Talley of the dead that's detailed and data driven.

This is in part a geographical consideration, however I recognise the distinction between Northern, Western and Eastern Europe in that sense is fairly arbitrary. Instead, I would argue that the relation exists on wider levels of culture, economics and politics, such that in general it should be natural to consistently refer to this as a distinct group with the UK included. This BBC article (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35374822) does a good job at listing a number of these points, but to give a broad overview of my thinking:\n\nPolitically:\n- They are joined together in multiple political organisations built around this grouping, such as the Northern Futures Forum and the Joint Expeditionary Force\n- They tend have a relative history of Euroscepticism, or otherwise being distinct from the rest of the EU/not in it at all\n- Almost all of them operate using some variation of a Parliamentary system\n\nEconomically:\n- Their economic systems are all far more oriented towards knowledge and innovation than the rest of Europe\n- Their government services tend to operate in similar ways, such as in single payer models of healthcare and in spending on welfare services\n- They all tend to contribute large proportions of their income on foreign aid relative to other nations\n\nCulturally:\n- They all tend to be far more socially liberal than the rest of the world in outlook\n- A much greater emphasis is placed in their societies on speaking good English\n- In general, their culture tends to be very similar to the UK in humour, personality etc\n\nIf you want to go further, you could even point out things like the UK flag looking similar to the Nordic ones and many of them having royal families!\n\nAs far as I can see, the only major exceptions to this lie in size (economically and in terms of population, the UK is more similar to Germany, France and Italy), and history, with the UK having a far more significant global role. However, given the number of above similarities these factors don\u2019t seem to be playing an enormous role overall.\n\nHence, I would argue that the UK is a Northern European country, not a Western European country.

We decided to buy because we got about $8k back in taxes. So our solar effectively cost $16k. \n\nOur old electric bill averaged $250 a month if you account for highs and lows so $3k a year. Our new electric bill is $500 a year. So we will get our moneys worth from solar in 6.5 years. Obviously this is an over simplification and there are a ton of other factors in play but it was a good deal for us.\n\nIf we invested that $16k we would have to make an average of 15% ROI to get the $2500 we saved from solar.\n\nAlso if we sell our house after 6.5 years any money that we get from the increase in value from paid off solar goes into our pocket.\n\nEdit. Also 2 intangibles that solar has helped with. \n\nMy wife and I stopped fighting over how to set the AC.

Sometimes I agree with them, other times I don't'.\n\nIn any case, why should we conclude that, if I don't like X, then I should make or do my own X?  In very many cases, it's simply impossible for me to do X. For instance, I can't make a massive, blockbuster CGI action movie. Does this mean that, if I watch such a movie and think it's complete rubbish, I'm not ''allowed'' to say so? 'Lord, that movie was terrible!' - 'Well, go make your own movie then!'.

It features all sorts of potential additions to the game, all made by fans. People vote on these items, and Valve chooses what to add (not necessarily the highest upvoted content). The makers get a cut of the sales' profits.\n\nBecause it is a for-profit venture, people eventually started figuring out how to put in the least amount of effort for the biggest returns. Nobody really knows what Valve will pick, so churning out lazily made items in bulk is a better strategy than making something fitting the game or the characters. Additionally, an item being on the front page helps its chances significantly. People will vote for items they like, of course, but people will also vote for memes, references to other media and things that would just be funny to see in game. I don't even want to get into fetish-inspired items.\n\nOn the surface this sounds well and good, but it has lead to significant deterioration of TF2's artstyle over the years. Fan made content added like this cannot be ignored, and a lot of it is hard to like. Making your own is an option (and people do make their own), but what gets picked is at Valve's discretion. Meaning badly made content just existing has a chance to get in and further ruin the spirit of the game.\n\nContent for the sake of content is not a good thing. The content should be good.

The mutual intelligibility of the two differs vastly based upon the context of communication I\u2019m having. A lot of communication lies in cultural awareness and the ability to mold language to the moment appropriately. \n\nAn anecdote from Siberia: I lived there awhile and met several folks trying to learn English or teach it. Given the geographic position of the region, they taught with a hybrid of various Anglo dialects. The US-British-Aussie dialect ended up being much clearer for me as a speaker of American English than pure British Standard English. By teaching English from the various perspectives of the Anglo world, the students had a very clear (but unspecialized, dialectically) form of English. My experience with Anglo fusion here makes me question your take on dialects. \n\nIs a dialect really able to become the clearest of them all? My experience shows a fusion is the clearest way to communicate. Dialectic specialization is great given a person\u2019s desire to live/work in a specific area. If the desire is to learn a versatile English, devoting oneself to one dialect may hinder growth and overall understanding of the language. Learning the language enough to move between dialects is a huge sign of mastery, yet a standard point should come before multi-dialectic mastery can be achieved. \n\nPerhaps because there are so many dialects of English, only a hybrid stands the chance of being the most intelligible. The lack of standard in hybrid English is its strength in being most widely understood. \n\nIf a Siberian student of English went up against a south Londoner and a Pittsburgher, I\u2019d imagine they\u2019d understand more than the pittsburgher or s Londoner would alone.", "title_sentiment": {"neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.674, "pos": 0.326, "compound": 0.4404}, "description_sentiment": {"neg": 0.077, "neu": 0.791, "pos": 0.133, "compound": 0.9452}, "comment_sentiment": {"neg": 0.025, "neu": 0.865, "pos": 0.11, "compound": 0.9742}, "title_keywords": {"CMV": 1, "dialects": 1, "better": 1, "others": 1}, "description_keywords": {"languages": 1, "different": 1, "dialects/accents": 1, "language": 3, "example": 1, "English": 10, "hundreds": 1, "varieties": 1, "British": 3, "Standard": 3, "better": 1, "others": 2, "reason": 1, "purpose": 1, "communication": 1, "dialect": 3, "\u2019": 2, "s": 1, "quality": 1, "success": 1, "rate": 1, "other": 4, "speakers": 2, "regardless": 1, "Due": 1, "historical": 1, "factors": 1, "colonization": 1, "cultural": 1, "imperialism": 1, "global": 2, "presence": 1, "sufficient": 1, "dialects": 6, "same": 2, "least": 1, "extent": 1, "African-American": 1, "Australian": 1, "Southern": 1, "American": 2, "Caribbean": 1, "etc": 1, "clear": 1, "wrong": 2, "worse": 1, "technical": 1, "sense": 2, "grammar": 1, "rules": 1, "utilitarian": 1, "understandable": 4, "familiar": 1, "view": 1, "m": 1, "understanding": 1, "standard": 1, "inappropriate": 1, "measure": 1, "Thank": 1, "t": 1, "care": 1, "Say": 1, "intra-comparisons": 1, "point": 1, "certain": 1, "applicable": 1, "context": 1, "basis": 1, "argument": 1}, "comment_keywords": {"different": 1, "English": 11, "job": 1, "American": 2, "academic": 1, "Indiana": 1, "neck": 1, "mutual": 1, "intelligibility": 1, "differs": 1, "context": 1, "communication": 2, "m": 1, "lot": 1, "lies": 1, "cultural": 1, "awareness": 1, "ability": 1, "language": 3, "moment": 1, "anecdote": 1, "Siberia": 1, "awhile": 1, "several": 1, "folks": 1, "geographic": 1, "position": 1, "region": 1, "hybrid": 3, "various": 2, "Anglo": 3, "dialects": 4, "US-British-Aussie": 1, "dialect": 3, "much": 1, "clearer": 1, "speaker": 1, "pure": 1, "British": 1, "Standard": 1, "perspectives": 1, "world": 1, "students": 1, "clear": 1, "form": 1, "experience": 2, "fusion": 2, "take": 1, "able": 1, "clearest": 2, "way": 1, "Dialectic": 1, "specialization": 1, "great": 1, "person": 1, "\u2019": 1, "s": 2, "desire": 2, "specific": 1, "area": 1, "versatile": 1, "growth": 1, "overall": 1, "understanding": 1, "enough": 1, "huge": 1, "sign": 1, "mastery": 2, "standard": 2, "point": 1, "multi-dialectic": 1, "many": 1, "chance": 1, "intelligible": 1, "lack": 1, "strength": 1, "most": 1, "understood": 1, "Siberian": 1, "student": 1, "south": 1, "Londoner": 2, "Pittsburgher": 1, "d": 2, "imagine": 1, "pittsburgher": 1}}, {"title": "CMV: Some dialects are better than others", "description": "I am not referring to languages here but simply different dialects/accents within a language.

Let me ask you something that hopefully isn't too personal: did you grow up working-class OP? If so, it doesn't surprise me! I'm a linguistic nerd, but I also grew up working class and ended up surrounded by a bunch of people who aren't, and I think I get what you're saying and where you're coming from. My argument isn't going to be based on utility or linguistic merit; simply **on taste.** I'm just going to use 3 examples OP, it might be a long post but I promise it's worth it. The three examples are going to be food, music, and art.\n\nSome context:\n\nThere's this dude named Pierre Bourdieu, and his work is kind of a hard concept to grasp. Basically, he argues that how we perceive ANYTHING is based on cultural factors, such as upbringing, education, and socioeconomic factors. I'll use myself as an example: I grew up eating a lot of spicy foods. Now, I eat a lot of spicy foods as an adult while some of my friends (who never touched the stuff growing up) still don't touch it as adults. Easy to follow along yeah? Ok, now let's do music.\n\nSay you grew up listening to rap; you can have phenomenally talented rappers who incorporate/master many aspects of music. Who is someone to say it's a trash genre compared to Mozart? This is an example of taste being a barrier to perception. There's merit in both, but one might just not see any of the merit in the other. I know people who call classical boring, I know people who call rap crap. They're both sheltered in their own way, I'm not going to get into the complexities of music, but just keep their adamancy in mind.\n\nThis \"taste barrier\" can also be seen in food, where Mexican food is looked down upon and things like french/italian cuisine is put on a pedastol. Both have merit and just because one is more popular and valued to different people doesn't make it better than the other; chef Anthony Bourdain (RIP GOAT) even recognized this. On a similar note; 2PAC is looked down upon while Mozart is also on that pedestal for similar reasons.\n\nThe last example I'm giving is about art. look at home decor: The rich get wild, crazy stuff in their place that serves no purpose, and it's \"artistic,\" while when the working class does it, it's \"tacky\" or just a knack. Fashion is also different. Think of leather jackets and cardigans; I learned that the working class values utility more than anything.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say OP is that  really more than popularity that makes a language **better**. POP is the most popular music in the world, but that **doesn't make it the best type of music** in the world. Hopefully you get what I'm trying to say here bud.\n\nBut if you think that one language can be better than most; then you also have to agree things like French food being the best in the world and pop music being the best in the world simply because there's a good chance most people won't hate it...which is a hot take imo but if that's your take so be it.

Why not? Portugal famously decriminalized all drugs years before this shift in American policy. Did Portugal also have a ln urban crack epidemic that they started? Did every country and province that followed suit?\n\n\nPolicies change. That's government. Hell, life changes. People look at something that isn't working and say \"what can we do instead?\" It's not a conspiracy, it's literally governance\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, the same people in power in the 80's are not running the entire country top to bottom. (Inb4 McConnell and Biden are old. Yes, but 99% of government has changed over) There are different decision makers making different decisions. There is nothing weird about that whatsoever.\u00a0\n\n\nHow silly would it be to say \"you can't tell me that the same government that that would not acknowledge gay people is now ok with it.\" Very silly. A government is not a stubborn human; it is literally just the sum of the people who govern. And again, there are different people governing. So it only makes sense that the sun adds up to a different result.\n\n\n&gt;where was this sympathy for crack users in the 80s and 90s\n\n\nThat's part of what changed. Society and eventually some elements of government started looking at it through a lens of \"how can we actually fix or alleviate this expensive, pervasive problem\" instead of \"how can we punish undesirable people\" because it wasn't working for literally anybody except the prison industry.\n\n\n&gt;If a government can go from locking people up for crack to enabling drug users then they definitely put crack in the hood\n\n\nAgain, this is not evidence or anything really.

Even if everything you say is true it isn't evidence the government _started_ the crack epidemic in the 80s.\n\nBut putting that aside, the evolution in policy you are seeing is an evolution of our understanding of drug use, its impact on society, and how to effectively lower harm.  \n\nIn the 80's/90's we were scared of rising crime rates associated with drug use and we decided that severe criminalization and law enforcement was the way to solve that problem.  People honestly thought cities would end up like they were depicted in _RoboCop_ - crime-ridden hellscapes where drug kingpins were more powerful than politicians.\n\nIn the decades that followed, we saw those policies were less effective than we had hoped.  Many feel that the \"war on drugs\" has been an abject failure, doing little to curb drug use and being responsible for the changing role of police in our society, including their militarization.  This says nothing about the impact those laws have had on many communities.\n\nSo folks are trying a different tactic.  Rather than treating drug use as a crime, they are treating it as an illness.  Safe injection sites, readily accessible OD mediation, testing strips, etc. are all policies to help mitigate the damage that drugs can do to the user.  We've accepted that folks who are doing drugs _are going to keep doing drugs_ so we are trying to make it as safe as possible while (hopefully) giving them access to resource to get clean.\n\nYou can disagree with this change in policy, and I'll be the first to say we don't know yet if this change will be effective.

Yes, it's illegal, but illegal and criminal are different concepts which only overlap somewhat.\n\nA good example of what I'm talking about is Flag Code (4 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 - \u00a7 10) which lays out the specific rules for how the US Flag is composed and displayed. There's a LOT of rules about this and if you do it wrong, even accidentally, it's illegal. Will anyone get in any trouble for this? No.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the law just explains *how* to do flag. Not what happens if you do flag wrong.\n\nCompare and contrast with something which *is* a crime. I'll use the popular happy fun crime of murder (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1111).\n\n\\[Pedant: this is the Federal statute under which you'd only be prosecuted if you were in a state park, on Federal property, out to sea but outside of the jurisdiction of any state, crossed state lines during the crime, a few other specific circumstances, or because they felt like it.\\]\n\nIf you read the statute, it's split into three easy to read sections:\n\n* a: They explain what constitutes a murder and define a first-degree and second-degree version of murder.\n* b: (This is the bit which separates 'illegal' from 'criminal'.) They explain what happens to a person found guilty of having committed a murder.\n* c: They specifically define a few words which appear in the statute to prevent ambiguity and clarify the intent of the law.\n\nInternet piracy is generally (but not always) a civil issue, not a criminal one. In most cases, you're not facing jailtime or execution. Only a civil judgement, maybe an injunction. Your only risk of jailtime is repeatedly flipping the bird to the judge but that's under Contempt of Court, not Copyright.\n\nTo be clear, there *are* cases where it's a crime but most of those wouldn't really involve the internet enough that someone would specifically refer to it as \"internet piracy\", only as \"piracy\".

I believe a person\u2019s character is defined by their thoughts, urges, and actions, which in turn is just a product of two things: brain chemistry and external stimuli. Upon receiving an external stimulus (which could be outwardly physical like the five senses or mental like a thought or emotion), the brain produces an output, like a thought, urge, or action, and then rewires itself based on the perceived reward (how good/bad something feels, also based on neurochemistry). As a person grows, this brain chemistry and input-output relationship becomes progressively built upon and defines what a person will do, think, or feel at any given moment. The state a person ends up in is thus defined by their starting brain chemistry, the method of rewiring, (both genetic/nature) and the environment they are in (circumstantial/nurture). This is just my understanding from my limited knowledge of how the brain learns, with some concepts from reinforcement learning thrown in\u2014very open to believing this could be wrong. But in this framework there is only the illusion of control and not control itself.\n\nFor example, imagine you had infinite computing power and some incredible simulation tools that could create a computational learning agent that would interact with a dynamic world around it. You initialize like a thousand of these agents by putting them in different environments with different starting variables, and let them loose and observe (to be fair this is almost already a reality!) The programmers/observers would likely say that any behavior is not under any moral guidelines, and understand that an agent\u2019s output and action are just a product of the code/math, randomness, and the environment. To me, our DNA operates extremely similarly, with a similar conclusion to be drawn about our behavior. If a person commits first degree murder or another heinous crime, they had no control over whether they would have the thoughts to commit the crime, or whether they lacked the neural guardrails to prevent them from doing it. Less drastically, many don\u2019t view addiction as a moral failure, because it\u2019s just brain chemistry\u2014some are inevitably more susceptible than others. Likewise if someone is \u201cmorally good\u201d it can be argued that they were just lucky that the product of their brain chemistry and environment aligned with societal values.\n\nThings and actions can still be judged good or bad, but they are evaluated in the context of whether they help you or not and not in the context of mortality. Therefore someone who is selfless, kind, and honest is considered good because they are less likely to harm you, while those who take pleasure in hurting others, lying, and death are more likely to harm you and are therefore bad. When expanded to the societal level, this creates cultural and social norms and laws, which are just a product of the people living in it (what people view as good and bad based on that brain chemistry) rather than some moral absolute. People are punished not because it\u2019s fair or moral, but because of power from collective interest.\n\nSo in practice, I understand that this shouldn\u2019t change most of how we live our lives\u2014we still undeniably have the illusion of choice, and shouldn\u2019t just let go of all accountability of ourselves. People should still be punished, and order should still be held. However, if we want to \u201crationally\u201d maintain some construct of fairness, rather than viewing some people as good or bad, lesser or more, based on their character (those thoughts, urges, and actions), we have empathy by realizing everyone just is a person and a product of things out of their control. Rather than demonizing \u201cevil\u201d and casting them aside with 0 remorse, it\u2019s something we look at with pity in that they were dealt a life of pain and suffering, both in what they received and caused. It\u2019s reasonable to think \u201cI would rather have this person on this earth than that person to live with for a happier life\u201d but unreasonable to think \u201cI am better than this person because if I were in their exact circumstance and had their same experience I would pick the more socially acceptable option\u201d because according to this model, you really wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s basically impossible to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes as an exercise to think that that person should have taken a different action. Likewise, for people that are a stereotypical \u201csaint,\u201d that is the hand they were dealt. \n\nVery interested in hearing counterpoints from the scientific and philosophical angle, as admittedly it\u2019s the best model of humanity that I can think of (and I\u2019m not a philosopher so I probably can\u2019t think of a lot). Also admittedly, this probably does sound like a big religion influenced-\u201ceveryone deserves love\u201d idea, which I\u2019m sure has some criticism. Thanks everyone!\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses. In doing so I think I may have made an error in how I phrased the topic statement\u2014my premises are the same though. To avoid replying in a very long post to everyone interested in discussing, I\u2019ll reframe here:\n\nPremise 1: The universe (and therefore human life)is predetermined. If we scientifically and mathematically proved today that the universe was predetermined, I would say this finding would be unsurprising as it is the most likely conclusion based on what we know of the universe already. To change my view, this probably requires some sort of scientific argument.\n\nPremise 2: Knowing this is the way of the world will not change your life in any way, nor our legal or societal structure. You cannot effectively use the fact that the universe is predetermined to justify any decision that you\u2019re making. You still feel the same emotions, feel the same quality of unfairness and what is reasonable\u2014whether they are predetermined or not doesn\u2019t matter in how you live your life. To change my view, this requires you to accept the hypothetical that we found out that the universe is predetermined and nothing else, and that in some way, life for you is now a completely different paradigm to what you were doing before. To me, the experience is the same\u2014you can\u2019t actually do anything with it because you can just as easily say \u201cI was fated to do this\u201d and do it as you can say \u201cI was fated not to do this\u201d and do the other thing. For all intents and purposes you still have to live like you have choices, things can still be reasonable, and things can still seem fair.\n\nPremise 3: Assuming you accepted the first two premises, I would argue that hatred/idolization of people are not a rational way to think about people\u2014ie the premise of this person is just inherently bad or evil or good doesn\u2019t make any sense. Of course people can still feel them because they are biologically driven, like lust or excitement, but when I step back and reason about it, there is no logical argument for why you could sustain hatred/disgust for another person. The only thing that pops out is that some people are more beneficial/more disadvantageous to your experience than others. You can still have enemies and people that are antithetical to your experience, but at the end of the day they are only doing what they think is right just as you are\u2014in another set of initialization variables, you would have done the same thing as your enemy. Everyone is just moving forward the way and doing what they believe to be best in the way that their biological code dictates. True good and evil no longer exist\u2014just human suffering and the absence of it. To change my view, one probably has to accept that the first two premises are true, and argue that it is still reasonable to hate someone, or think that people are still inherently evil in a way that is separate from believing they are just more dangerous to you and society.", "comment": "/u/Delicious-Schedule-4 (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP

character isn\u2019t reasonable or fair because they have no control over it", "description": "Sorry in advance if this has been posted before or is a hackneyed thought (eg we\u2019re living in a simulation and nothing matters). I believe a person\u2019s character is defined by their thoughts, urges, and actions, which in turn is just a product of two things: brain chemistry and external stimuli. Upon receiving an external stimulus (which could be outwardly physical like the five senses or mental like a thought or emotion), the brain produces an output, like a thought, urge, or action, and then rewires itself based on the perceived reward (how good/bad something feels, also based on neurochemistry). As a person grows, this brain chemistry and input-output relationship becomes progressively built upon and defines what a person will do, think, or feel at any given moment. The state a person ends up in is thus defined by their starting brain chemistry, the method of rewiring, (both genetic/nature) and the environment they are in (circumstantial/nurture). This is just my understanding from my limited knowledge of how the brain learns, with some concepts from reinforcement learning thrown in\u2014very open to believing this could be wrong. But in this framework there is only the illusion of control and not control itself.\n\nFor example, imagine you had infinite computing power and some incredible simulation tools that could create a computational learning agent that would interact with a dynamic world around it. You initialize like a thousand of these agents by putting them in different environments with different starting variables, and let them loose and observe (to be fair this is almost already a reality!) The programmers/observers would likely say that any behavior is not under any moral guidelines, and understand that an agent\u2019s output and action are just a product of the code/math, randomness, and the environment. To me, our DNA operates extremely similarly, with a similar conclusion to be drawn about our behavior. If a person commits first degree murder or another heinous crime, they had no control over whether they would have the thoughts to commit the crime, or whether they lacked the neural guardrails to prevent them from doing it. Less drastically, many don\u2019t view addiction as a moral failure, because it\u2019s just brain chemistry\u2014some are inevitably more susceptible than others. Likewise if someone is \u201cmorally good\u201d it can be argued that they were just lucky that the product of their brain chemistry and environment aligned with societal values.\n\nThings and actions can still be judged good or bad, but they are evaluated in the context of whether they help you or not and not in the context of mortality. Therefore someone who is selfless, kind, and honest is considered good because they are less likely to harm you, while those who take pleasure in hurting others, lying, and death are more likely to harm you and are therefore bad. When expanded to the societal level, this creates cultural and social norms and laws, which are just a product of the people living in it (what people view as good and bad based on that brain chemistry) rather than some moral absolute. People are punished not because it\u2019s fair or moral, but because of power from collective interest.\n\nSo in practice, I understand that this shouldn\u2019t change most of how we live our lives\u2014we still undeniably have the illusion of choice, and shouldn\u2019t just let go of all accountability of ourselves. People should still be punished, and order should still be held. However, if we want to \u201crationally\u201d maintain some construct of fairness, rather than viewing some people as good or bad, lesser or more, based on their character (those thoughts, urges, and actions), we have empathy by realizing everyone just is a person and a product of things out of their control. Rather than demonizing \u201cevil\u201d and casting them aside with 0 remorse, it\u2019s something we look at with pity in that they were dealt a life of pain and suffering, both in what they received and caused. It\u2019s reasonable to think \u201cI would rather have this person on this earth than that person to live with for a happier life\u201d but unreasonable to think \u201cI am better than this person because if I were in their exact circumstance and had their same experience I would pick the more socially acceptable option\u201d because according to this model, you really wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s basically impossible to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes as an exercise to think that that person should have taken a different action. Likewise, for people that are a stereotypical \u201csaint,\u201d that is the hand they were dealt. \n\nVery interested in hearing counterpoints from the scientific and philosophical angle, as admittedly it\u2019s the best model of humanity that I can think of (and I\u2019m not a philosopher so I probably can\u2019t think of a lot). Also admittedly, this probably does sound like a big religion influenced-\u201ceveryone deserves love\u201d idea, which I\u2019m sure has some criticism. Thanks everyone!\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses. In doing so I think I may have made an error in how I phrased the topic statement\u2014my premises are the same though. To avoid replying in a very long post to everyone interested in discussing, I\u2019ll reframe here:\n\nPremise 1: The universe (and therefore human life)is predetermined. If we scientifically and mathematically proved today that the universe was predetermined, I would say this finding would be unsurprising as it is the most likely conclusion based on what we know of the universe already. To change my view, this probably requires some sort of scientific argument.\n\nPremise 2: Knowing this is the way of the world will not change your life in any way, nor our legal or societal structure. You cannot effectively use the fact that the universe is predetermined to justify any decision that you\u2019re making. You still feel the same emotions, feel the same quality of unfairness and what is reasonable\u2014whether they are predetermined or not doesn\u2019t matter in how you live your life. To change my view, this requires you to accept the hypothetical that we found out that the universe is predetermined and nothing else, and that in some way, life for you is now a completely different paradigm to what you were doing before. To me, the experience is the same\u2014you can\u2019t actually do anything with it because you can just as easily say \u201cI was fated to do this\u201d and do it as you can say \u201cI was fated not to do this\u201d and do the other thing. For all intents and purposes you still have to live like you have choices, things can still be reasonable, and things can still seem fair.\n\nPremise 3: Assuming you accepted the first two premises, I would argue that hatred/idolization of people are not a rational way to think about people\u2014ie the premise of this person is just inherently bad or evil or good doesn\u2019t make any sense. Of course people can still feel them because they are biologically driven, like lust or excitement, but when I step back and reason about it, there is no logical argument for why you could sustain hatred/disgust for another person. The only thing that pops out is that some people are more beneficial/more disadvantageous to your experience than others. You can still have enemies and people that are antithetical to your experience, but at the end of the day they are only doing what they think is right just as you are\u2014in another set of initialization variables, you would have done the same thing as your enemy. Everyone is just moving forward the way and doing what they believe to be best in the way that their biological code dictates. True good and evil no longer exist\u2014just human suffering and the absence of it. To change my view, one probably has to accept that the first two premises are true, and argue that it is still reasonable to hate someone, or think that people are still inherently evil in a way that is separate from believing they are just more dangerous to you and society.", "comment": "If people don't have a choice about being evil, I don't have a choice about demonizing them for it.", "title_sentiment": {"neg": 0.126, "neu": 0.743, "pos": 0.131, "compound": 0.0258}, "description_sentiment": {"neg": 0.118, "neu": 0.774, "pos": 0.108, "compound": -0.9777}, "comment_sentiment": {"neg": 0.227, "neu": 0.773, "pos": 0.0, "compound": -0.6597}, "title_keywords": {"CMV": 1, "people": 1, "\u2019": 2, "character": 1, "isn": 1, "t": 1, "reasonable": 1, "fair": 1, "control": 1}, "description_keywords": {"Sorry": 1, "advance": 1, "hackneyed": 1, "thought": 3, "re": 2, "living": 1, "simulation": 2, "nothing": 2, "matters": 1, "person": 12, "\u2019": 11, "s": 5, "character": 2, "thoughts": 3, "urges": 2, "actions": 3, "turn": 1, "product": 5, "things": 4, "brain": 8, "chemistry": 5, "external": 2, "stimuli": 1, "stimulus": 1, "physical": 1, "senses": 1, "mental": 1, "emotion": 1, "output": 2, "urge": 1, "action": 3, "reward": 1, "something": 2, "feels": 1, "neurochemistry": 1, "input-output": 1, "relationship": 1, "moment": 1, "state": 1, "starting": 1, "method": 1, "rewiring": 1, "genetic/nature": 1, "environment": 3, "circumstantial/nurture": 1, "understanding": 1, "limited": 1, "knowledge": 1, "learns": 1, "concepts": 1, "reinforcement": 1, "thrown": 1, "in\u2014very": 1, "open": 1, "wrong": 1, "framework": 1, "illusion": 2, "control": 3, "example": 1, "power": 2, "incredible": 1, "tools": 1, "computational": 1, "learning": 1, "agent": 2, "dynamic": 1, "world": 2, "thousand": 1, "agents": 1, "different": 4, "environments": 1, "variables": 2, "fair": 3, "reality": 1, "programmers/observers": 1, "behavior": 2, "moral": 4, "guidelines": 1, "code/math": 1, "randomness": 1, "DNA": 1, "similarly": 1, "similar": 1, "conclusion": 2, "degree": 1, "murder": 1, "heinous": 1, "crime": 2, "neural": 1, "guardrails": 1, "many": 1, "t": 7, "view": 4, "addiction": 1, "failure": 1, "chemistry\u2014some": 1, "susceptible": 1, "others": 3, "someone": 4, "good": 7, "lucky": 1, "societal": 3, "values": 1, "Things": 1, "bad": 5, "context": 2, "mortality": 1, "kind": 1, "honest": 1, "likely": 3, "pleasure": 1, "death": 1, "level": 1, "cultural": 1, "social": 1, "norms": 1, "laws": 1, "people": 9, "absolute": 1, "People": 2, "collective": 1, "interest": 1, "practice": 1, "shouldn": 2, "change": 1, "most": 1, "lives\u2014we": 1, "choice": 1, "accountability": 1, "ourselves": 1, "order": 1, "\u201d": 8, "construct": 1, "fairness": 1, "lesser": 1, "more": 2, "everyone": 5, "Rather": 1, "\u201c": 6, "evil": 3, "remorse": 1, "pity": 1, "life": 6, "pain": 1, "suffering": 2, "reasonable": 3, "earth": 1, "happier": 1, "unreasonable": 1, "exact": 1, "circumstance": 1, "same": 5, "experience": 4, "acceptable": 1, "option": 1, "model": 2, "impossible": 1, "shoes": 1, "exercise": 1, "Likewise": 1, "stereotypical": 1, "saint": 1, "hand": 1, "dealt": 1, "interested": 2, "counterpoints": 1, "scientific": 2, "philosophical": 1, "angle": 1, "best": 2, "humanity": 1, "philosopher": 1, "think": 1, "lot": 1, "big": 1, "religion": 1, "influenced-": 1, "idea": 1, "m": 1, "sure": 1, "criticism": 1, "Thanks": 1, "EDIT": 1, "Thank": 1, "responses": 1, "error": 1, "topic": 1, "statement\u2014my": 1, "premises": 3, "though": 1, "post": 1, "ll": 1, "reframe": 1, "Premise": 1, "universe": 5, "human": 2, "today": 1, "finding": 1, "unsurprising": 1, "sort": 1, "argument": 2, "way": 7, "legal": 1, "structure": 1, "fact": 1, "decision": 1, "making": 1, "emotions": 1, "quality": 1, "unfairness": 1, "reasonable\u2014whether": 1, "doesn": 2, "matter": 1, "hypothetical": 1, "paradigm": 1, "same\u2014you": 1, "anything": 1, "other": 1, "thing": 3, "intents": 1, "purposes": 1, "choices": 1, "Assuming": 1, "first": 2, "hatred/idolization": 1, "rational": 1, "premise": 1, "sense": 1, "course": 1, "lust": 1, "excitement": 1, "reason": 1, "logical": 1, "hatred/disgust": 1, "only": 1, "disadvantageous": 1, "enemies": 1, "antithetical": 1, "end": 1, "day": 1, "right": 1, "set": 1, "initialization": 1, "enemy": 1, "Everyone": 1, "biological": 1, "code": 1, "dictates": 1, "absence": 1, "true": 1, "separate": 1, "dangerous": 1, "society": 1}, "comment_keywords": {"people": 1, "choice": 2, "evil": 1}}, {"title": "CMV: Judging people\u2019s character isn\u2019t reasonable or fair because they have no control over it", "description": "Sorry in advance if this has been posted before or is a hackneyed thought (eg we\u2019re living in a simulation and nothing matters).

Taking away individual agency and decision making. The only way to convince you would be to prove that actions aren\u2019t predestined and each individual has a choice.  \n\nFurther, you\u2019re claiming an argument of moral superiority when you say that the real unreasonable and unfair thing are the JUDGEMENTS of people\u2019s actions and NOT the actions themself. You\u2019re kind of just doing what you claim is unreasonable and unfair.  \n\nFurther, why do you find the JUDGEMENTS to be the unreasonable or unfair thing when judgements don\u2019t have the same consequences as the actions and behaviors being judged? By your logic, someone could be an absolute shit human being, damaging all the people around them and still should be worthy of more empathy and sympathy than the people they impacted.

"description": "Sorry in advance if this has been posted before or is a hackneyed thought (eg we\u2019re living in a simulation and nothing matters). I believe a person\u2019s character is defined by their thoughts, urges, and actions, which in turn is just a product of two things: brain chemistry and external stimuli. Upon receiving an external stimulus (which could be outwardly physical like the five senses or mental like a thought or emotion), the brain produces an output, like a thought, urge, or action, and then rewires itself based on the perceived reward (how good/bad something feels, also based on neurochemistry). As a person grows, this brain chemistry and input-output relationship becomes progressively built upon and defines what a person will do, think, or feel at any given moment. The state a person ends up in is thus defined by their starting brain chemistry, the method of rewiring, (both genetic/nature) and the environment they are in (circumstantial/nurture). This is just my understanding from my limited knowledge of how the brain learns, with some concepts from reinforcement learning thrown in\u2014very open to believing this could be wrong. But in this framework there is only the illusion of control and not control itself.\n\nFor example, imagine you had infinite computing power and some incredible simulation tools that could create a computational learning agent that would interact with a dynamic world around it. You initialize like a thousand of these agents by putting them in different environments with different starting variables, and let them loose and observe (to be fair this is almost already a reality!) The programmers/observers would likely say that any behavior is not under any moral guidelines, and understand that an agent\u2019s output and action are just a product of the code/math, randomness, and the environment. To me, our DNA operates extremely similarly, with a similar conclusion to be drawn about our behavior. If a person commits first degree murder or another heinous crime, they had no control over whether they would have the thoughts to commit the crime, or whether they lacked the neural guardrails to prevent them from doing it. Less drastically, many don\u2019t view addiction as a moral failure, because it\u2019s just brain chemistry\u2014some are inevitably more susceptible than others. Likewise if someone is \u201cmorally good\u201d it can be argued that they were just lucky that the product of their brain chemistry and environment aligned with societal values.\n\nThings and actions can still be judged good or bad, but they are evaluated in the context of whether they help you or not and not in the context of mortality. Therefore someone who is selfless, kind, and honest is considered good because they are less likely to harm you, while those who take pleasure in hurting others, lying, and death are more likely to harm you and are therefore bad. When expanded to the societal level, this creates cultural and social norms and laws, which are just a product of the people living in it (what people view as good and bad based on that brain chemistry) rather than some moral absolute. People are punished not because it\u2019s fair or moral, but because of power from collective interest.\n\nSo in practice, I understand that this shouldn\u2019t change most of how we live our lives\u2014we still undeniably have the illusion of choice, and shouldn\u2019t just let go of all accountability of ourselves. People should still be punished, and order should still be held. However, if we want to \u201crationally\u201d maintain some construct of fairness, rather than viewing some people as good or bad, lesser or more, based on their character (those thoughts, urges, and actions), we have empathy by realizing everyone just is a person and a product of things out of their control. Rather than demonizing \u201cevil\u201d and casting them aside with 0 remorse, it\u2019s something we look at with pity in that they were dealt a life of pain and suffering, both in what they received and caused. It\u2019s reasonable to think \u201cI would rather have this person on this earth than that person to live with for a happier life\u201d but unreasonable to think \u201cI am better than this person because if I were in their exact circumstance and had their same experience I would pick the more socially acceptable option\u201d because according to this model, you really wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s basically impossible to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes as an exercise to think that that person should have taken a different action. Likewise, for people that are a stereotypical \u201csaint,\u201d that is the hand they were dealt. \n\nVery interested in hearing counterpoints from the scientific and philosophical angle, as admittedly it\u2019s the best model of humanity that I can think of (and I\u2019m not a philosopher so I probably can\u2019t think of a lot). Also admittedly, this probably does sound like a big religion influenced-\u201ceveryone deserves love\u201d idea, which I\u2019m sure has some criticism. Thanks everyone!\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses. In doing so I think I may have made an error in how I phrased the topic statement\u2014my premises are the same though. To avoid replying in a very long post to everyone interested in discussing, I\u2019ll reframe here:\n\nPremise 1: The universe (and therefore human life)is predetermined. If we scientifically and mathematically proved today that the universe was predetermined, I would say this finding would be unsurprising as it is the most likely conclusion based on what we know of the universe already. To change my view, this probably requires some sort of scientific argument.\n\nPremise 2: Knowing this is the way of the world will not change your life in any way, nor our legal or societal structure. You cannot effectively use the fact that the universe is predetermined to justify any decision that you\u2019re making. You still feel the same emotions, feel the same quality of unfairness and what is reasonable\u2014whether they are predetermined or not doesn\u2019t matter in how you live your life. To change my view, this requires you to accept the hypothetical that we found out that the universe is predetermined and nothing else, and that in some way, life for you is now a completely different paradigm to what you were doing before. To me, the experience is the same\u2014you can\u2019t actually do anything with it because you can just as easily say \u201cI was fated to do this\u201d and do it as you can say \u201cI was fated not to do this\u201d and do the other thing. For all intents and purposes you still have to live like you have choices, things can still be reasonable, and things can still seem fair.\n\nPremise 3: Assuming you accepted the first two premises, I would argue that hatred/idolization of people are not a rational way to think about people\u2014ie the premise of this person is just inherently bad or evil or good doesn\u2019t make any sense. Of course people can still feel them because they are biologically driven, like lust or excitement, but when I step back and reason about it, there is no logical argument for why you could sustain hatred/disgust for another person. The only thing that pops out is that some people are more beneficial/more disadvantageous to your experience than others. You can still have enemies and people that are antithetical to your experience, but at the end of the day they are only doing what they think is right just as you are\u2014in another set of initialization variables, you would have done the same thing as your enemy. Everyone is just moving forward the way and doing what they believe to be best in the way that their biological code dictates. True good and evil no longer exist\u2014just human suffering and the absence of it. To change my view, one probably has to accept that the first two premises are true, and argue that it is still reasonable to hate someone, or think that people are still inherently evil in a way that is separate from believing they are just more dangerous to you and society.", "comment": "One can change their character, I'm sure you agree you have a different character as an adult as you did a
