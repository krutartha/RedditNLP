The works is a far more stable and safer place when the United states has a military of overwhelming capabilities.  We want our military to be stronger and more advanced than all of our adversaries combined. \n\nThat said the context that's missing in this article is\n1. these 2 new carriers were slated to replace carriers that are still in service and still far more powerful and advanced than anything China (or anyone else)  has. \n\n2. The carriers China has are not true carriers.  They are what is called jump carriers, sometimes referred to as mini carriers. They are much shorter in design and their flight deck is built with a sloped ramp to get aircraft air borne. Because of these design differences they only hold a small portion of the aircraft.  I believe it is 17 combat fighters. In comparison our old carriers that are slated to be replaced hold 90. The new ford class holds 137. 1 of our old ones equals over 4 of theirs in capability without even considering how much more technologically advanced or farther and fighter craft are. The f22 is virtually invisible on radar with a cross section of less than .0001/square meters.  That's smaller than a bubble bee. They can not be shot down with guided munitions.  Line of sight spray and pray is their only risk.   The fuijan will be China first true carrier and while that is a threat to be taken seriously, they don't have the anything comparably to the f22 to stick on it. It's going to be armed with technologically outdated fighters.  \n\n3. In contrast to China, the United states currently has 11 true fleet carriers. 10 Nimitz class and 1 ford class. And not just the carriers, but entire carrier strike groups comprised of over a dozen war ships and several dozen support ships. In addition to the fleet carter's we have an additional 10+ light carriers. \n\nIn conclusion, while on the surface it is concerning to see China investing to expand their military capabilities while we show down our plans to update our fleet, we don't need to freak out.  The difference between the militaries is like comparing a random high school jv team to the Dallas cowboys of the early 90s, 49ers of the 80s our patriots of the 2000s.
