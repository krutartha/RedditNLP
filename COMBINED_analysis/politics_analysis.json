Back in the car, however, his worries and frustrations spilled out. Khanna is 47, three decades younger than the two men set to be on the ballot in November. He\u2019s waiting\u2014not altogether patiently\u2014for the decks to clear, for the Biden and Sanders generation to finally retire. \u2018We haven\u2019t been driving a clear message,\u2019 Khanna told me. \u2018We have to have a better message on the economy, and we have to have a better message on immigration.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe proximate cause of Khanna\u2019s distress was the bipartisan southern-border compromise that was then emerging from the Senate\u2014and which, at the behest of former President Donald Trump, Republicans promptly killed. Khanna wasn\u2019t a fan of the deal. He had wanted Biden to give a rousing speech about why immigration matters to America; instead, the president was about to give Republicans almost everything they wanted. \u2018You\u2019ve got no affirmative case\u2019 Khanna told me. \u2018There\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s a void.\u2019 What\u2019s missing, he said, is \u2018an aspirational vision.\u2019\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s Khanna\u2019s. He wants to marry the forward-looking spirit of the companies founded in and around his district\u2014Google, Apple, Tesla\u2014with the traditional middle-class values of his suburban upbringing in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

Those renewal applications are seeing processing times of up to 16 months.\n\n\u201cEmployers in our states cannot afford to wait until mid-April to know whether their employees will be able to continue working legally,\u201d according to the letter spearheaded by Sens.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(D-Mass.) and\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand\u00a0(D-N.Y.). \u201cThese employers need to be able to plan and operate knowing that their workforce will not be disrupted by abrupt changes in work authorization status.\u201d\n\nWork permits are typically valid for 180 days after expiration if there\u2019s a renewal application pending at US Citizenship and Immigration Services. But processing backlogs extending beyond that six-month period led the agency in 2022 to issue temporary regulations extending the grace period to a year and a half.\n\nThose regulations expired in October\u2014reverting the grace period back to 180 days\u2014yet long wait times have persisted, putting the employment authorization of many immigrants at risk, lawmakers noted. More than 279,000 work permit renewal applications were pending by September 2023, according to the latest figures released by USCIS.\n\n[Read more here. ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/democrats-push-to-expedite-rule-extending-immigrant-work-permits?utm_source=reddit.com&amp;utm_medium=lawdesk)", "title_sentiment": {"neg": 0.0, "neu": 1.0, "pos": 0.0, "compound": 0.0}, "description_sentiment": {"neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0, "pos": 0.0, "compound": 0.0}, "comment_sentiment": {"neg": 0.017, "neu": 0.954, "pos": 0.029, "compound": 0.6187}, "title_keywords": {"Democrats": 1, "Push": 1, "Expedite": 1, "Rule": 1, "Extending": 1, "Immigrant": 1, "Work": 1, "Permits": 1}, "description_keywords": {}, "comment_keywords": {"*": 3, "reporter": 1, "Andrew": 1, "Kreighbaum": 1, "A": 1, "group": 1, "congressional": 1, "Democrats": 1, "Biden": 1, "administration": 1, "fast-track": 1, "regulations": 3, "employment": 2, "authorization": 4, "thousands": 1, "immigrants": 3, "work": 4, "permits": 3, "month": 1, "Businesses": 1, "immigrant": 1, "employees": 2, "uncertainty": 1, "future": 1, "host": 1, "government-issued": 1, "April": 1, "documents": 1, "last": 1, "fall": 1, "lawmakers": 2, "letter": 2, "Monday": 1, "renewal": 3, "applications": 2, "times": 2, "months": 1, "\u201c": 1, "Employers": 1, "states": 1, "mid-April": 1, "able": 2, "Sens": 1, "Elizabeth": 1, "Warren": 1, "D-Mass": 1, "Kirsten": 1, "Gillibrand": 1, "D-N.Y.": 1, "employers": 1, "knowing": 1, "workforce": 1, "abrupt": 1, "changes": 1, "status.": 1, "\u201d": 1, "Work": 1, "valid": 1, "days": 1, "expiration": 1, "\u2019": 1, "application": 1, "US": 1, "Citizenship": 1, "Immigration": 1, "Services": 1, "backlogs": 1, "six-month": 1, "period": 3, "agency": 1, "temporary": 1, "grace": 2, "year": 1, "half": 1, "days\u2014yet": 1, "long": 1, "wait": 1, "many": 1, "risk": 1, "More": 1, "permit": 1, "September": 1, "latest": 1, "figures": 1, "USCIS": 1, "more": 1, "]": 1, "https": 1, "//news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/democrats-push-to-expedite-rule-extending-immigrant-work-permits": 1, "utm_source=reddit.com": 1, "amp": 1, "utm_medium=lawdesk": 1}}, {"title": "Ronna McDaniel mess shows problem of politics-to-pundit conveyor belt", "description": "", "comment": "\nAs a reminder, this subreddit [is for civil discussion.](/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil)\n\nIn general, be courteous to others.
