The 7-8k Missing category that the GHM mentions is probably disproportionately fighting age males. \n\nOne of the clearest indicators of this is the fact that terrorists killed during the Oct. 7 offensive do not seem to show up on the list.

They plan to claim victory/they fought off Israel after the war ends. It's the same reason they publish their absurdly fake Talley of Israeli casualties and the videos of RPG ambushes that don't show impact. They can't honestly admit to the Palastinian people that 2/3rds of their battalions have been smashed. \n\nIt's awkward for Israel because:\n\nIsrael actually has killed an absolute fuck ton of civilians. The ratio isn't quite as lopsided as the GMH Talley suggests. But 12k dead Palastinian children is a lot.

All of my female family members have been raped. I have been raped before aswell. Whenever I tell a man about it, I am treated as though I am \"damaged goods\", a slut, even. As though I have lost my value due to being defiled. I've had an aunt get cheated on and divorced because her husband was no longer attracted to her post-pregnancy body. A pregnancy the husband insisted on, I might add.\n\nI usually try to stay away from social media, but whenever I expose myself to it, there's tons of men complaining about women. Tons of men making negative comments about women. Too many men threatening to rape and murder women. As though their brains have rotted out with porn.\n\nThere's a lot about it that gripes me. Honestly for some reason I seem to be bombarded with men claiming that women's genitalia reveal their promiscuity. I'm sure you can derive what I mean by this. Such remarks have caused me to shut myself away from any possible romantic interaction. \n\nI see men complaining about how their wives have headaches or stomachaches, how they nag. That a perfect woman is nothing more than a lone pair of legs. I see men replacing their girlfriends for newer, more attractive ones. Like replacing an appliance with a new model. I see men demanding sex from women. It's always about sex. It's always sex. I always see that the most. A type of \"entitlement\" to sex.\n\nI've dumbed down myself to a useless vessel, a whore, a nagging bitch, practically all of the terrible words you can think of because of this.\n\nI've been treating all men as though they are out to hurt me, that their ultimate goal is to get a good lay and throw me out when better comes around. That who I am as a person doesn't matter. I treat all of them as though they are sick, disgusting deviants. It's caused my relationship with my father to strain aswell.\n\nI am desperate to lose this view. I want to see the good in them. I want to believe there's men out there that care about me, that want to listen to what I have to say, and are genuinely interested in me as a person. I don't want to be scared or intimidated by them. I don't want to think my own father fantasizes about raping me. I want a man to think of protecting me after hearing what happened to me instead of stating my loss in value.

we\u2019re living in a simulation and nothing matters). I believe a person\u2019s character is defined by their thoughts, urges, and actions, which in turn is just a product of two things: brain chemistry and external stimuli. Upon receiving an external stimulus (which could be outwardly physical like the five senses or mental like a thought or emotion), the brain produces an output, like a thought, urge, or action, and then rewires itself based on the perceived reward (how good/bad something feels, also based on neurochemistry). As a person grows, this brain chemistry and input-output relationship becomes progressively built upon and defines what a person will do, think, or feel at any given moment. The state a person ends up in is thus defined by their starting brain chemistry, the method of rewiring, (both genetic/nature) and the environment they are in (circumstantial/nurture). This is just my understanding from my limited knowledge of how the brain learns, with some concepts from reinforcement learning thrown in\u2014very open to believing this could be wrong. But in this framework there is only the illusion of control and not control itself.\n\nFor example, imagine you had infinite computing power and some incredible simulation tools that could create a computational learning agent that would interact with a dynamic world around it. You initialize like a thousand of these agents by putting them in different environments with different starting variables, and let them loose and observe (to be fair this is almost already a reality!) The programmers/observers would likely say that any behavior is not under any moral guidelines, and understand that an agent\u2019s output and action are just a product of the code/math, randomness, and the environment. To me, our DNA operates extremely similarly, with a similar conclusion to be drawn about our behavior. If a person commits first degree murder or another heinous crime, they had no control over whether they would have the thoughts to commit the crime, or whether they lacked the neural guardrails to prevent them from doing it. Less drastically, many don\u2019t view addiction as a moral failure, because it\u2019s just brain chemistry\u2014some are inevitably more susceptible than others. Likewise if someone is \u201cmorally good\u201d it can be argued that they were just lucky that the product of their brain chemistry and environment aligned with societal values.\n\nThings and actions can still be judged good or bad, but they are evaluated in the context of whether they help you or not and not in the context of mortality. Therefore someone who is selfless, kind, and honest is considered good because they are less likely to harm you, while those who take pleasure in hurting others, lying, and death are more likely to harm you and are therefore bad. When expanded to the societal level, this creates cultural and social norms and laws, which are just a product of the people living in it (what people view as good and bad based on that brain chemistry) rather than some moral absolute. People are punished not because it\u2019s fair or moral, but because of power from collective interest.\n\nSo in practice, I understand that this shouldn\u2019t change most of how we live our lives\u2014we still undeniably have the illusion of choice, and shouldn\u2019t just let go of all accountability of ourselves. People should still be punished, and order should still be held. However, if we want to \u201crationally\u201d maintain some construct of fairness, rather than viewing some people as good or bad, lesser or more, based on their character (those thoughts, urges, and actions), we have empathy by realizing everyone just is a person and a product of things out of their control. Rather than demonizing \u201cevil\u201d and casting them aside with 0 remorse, it\u2019s something we look at with pity in that they were dealt a life of pain and suffering, both in what they received and caused. It\u2019s reasonable to think \u201cI would rather have this person on this earth than that person to live with for a happier life\u201d but unreasonable to think \u201cI am better than this person because if I were in their exact circumstance and had their same experience I would pick the more socially acceptable option\u201d because according to this model, you really wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s basically impossible to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes as an exercise to think that that person should have taken a different action. Likewise, for people that are a stereotypical \u201csaint,\u201d that is the hand they were dealt. \n\nVery interested in hearing counterpoints from the scientific and philosophical angle, as admittedly it\u2019s the best model of humanity that I can think of (and I\u2019m not a philosopher so I probably can\u2019t think of a lot). Also admittedly, this probably does sound like a big religion influenced-\u201ceveryone deserves love\u201d idea, which I\u2019m sure has some criticism.
