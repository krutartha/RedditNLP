[{"title": "Are the anti-Biden Left equivalent to the Never-Trump Right?", "description": "Since the attack on Israel on Oct 7th of last year by Hamas and the forceful response to that terrorism by Israel, many on the Left have protested Biden and those Democrats who support Israel as unacceptable to the point where some say they won't vote for Biden in November. Similarly, in 2016, a group of conservative Republicans didn't like Trump because he didn't uphold conservative values or principles and vowed not to vote for him then and for many, ever again. They became Never-Trumpers. Some even decided to support Biden and left the GOP.\n\nDo you see a similar phenomenon happening to those who decry Biden's support for Israel and pledge not to vote for him for president? Will they become essentially Never-Biden liberals, where a noticeable few defect and even support Trump over Biden, just as some Never-Trumpers did?

They don't necessarily have opposition to Biden, just what he's doing at the moment, which is something that can change.  There's a decent chance in the secrecy of the voting both they'll actually vote for him, regardless of what changes eventually happen.  Never-Trumpers are opposed to everything about the person; there's not really anything the MAGA-wing could do to bring them onside, since ideologically, they're mostly aligned already.", "I\u2019d say I\u2019m anti-Biden, but it\u2019s still in my best interest to vote strategically, which means Biden is clearly better than trump.

It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to enthusiastically vote for Biden, but so far most protest votes I\u2019ve seen have been about withholding primary support to show the impact they can have, while also planning on voting for Biden in the general.

The never-Trumpers, on the other hand, don't necessarily have policy issues with Trump. There problems are in his very style and personality. They are more likely to jump, because they do have alternate candidates who, while they may have more policy disagreements with (such as Biden), are more appropriate to the office of President.", "The two are similar in that they both reject their respective candidates on a truly heart felt principle. The Never-Trump Republican has propensity to side with the prior powers that be with conservatism of the Edmund Burke slow gradual reforms without getting rid of the valuable aspects of the current status quo. The Never-Biden Left are opposed to the gradualism of the liberal establishment, that there are brightlines that should never be crossed even if led across them by allies who have always been allies. If the UK responded to IRA terrorism in the 1970s-1980s with an invasion of the Republic of Ireland, would the liberal Establishment (of which Biden would have been a junior member of at the time) cut ties with their NATO ally? Unlikely, but there would be plenty of voters who would have had a similar response to the Never-Biden voters today that Israel has crossed the brightline with the 50+ year brutal occupation of West Bank, Gaza, and the Golan Heights (which Israel succeeded in depopulating all Arabs from and completed the conversion to wholly Israel, recognized by Trump and not being rescinded by Biden) and the deliberate starving of 2.2 million people in Gaza by the IDF.\n \nEither you are against war crimes or your not, but you won't get voters who find supporting war crimes as being beyond the pale without acknowledging the crimes against humanity that Israel is committing. Never-Trump right see as brightline that steady and dependable values are the definition to being a conservative, and like giving darts to a monkey Trump may wildly fling about policy that hits a bullseye for the conservatives but the capricious nature is never going to change about Trump. Never-Biden left sees the support of Israel as the brightline that can't be compromised despite Biden given compromised lipservice in that regard (\"my administration has strongly communicated with Netanyahu that we are greatly displeased with the civilian loss of life\" will never be enough to get Never-Biden voters back) there's more deliberateness in Biden's actions that he won't deliver for the Never-Bidens like Trump can for the Never-Trumps.", "Trump won in 2016 without the support of the never Trump right.

They cite how Trumpers have become a cult, how he has taken over the apparatus of the Republican Party, etc. Also very valid reasons to oppose Trump. \n\nHowever, fundamentally, the reasons are very different.

No one who believes we are committing mass atrocities, and have a disregard for doesn\u2019t think Trump wouldn\u2019t do the same or worse as well, certainly.  So, folks who protest Biden and other Dems for the mass atrocities they are committing will not flip support to Trump or republicans.

US breaking treaties was vile and reprehensible, but it was the time period, it happened between bigger nations too (British Impressment post Revolutionary War was a violation of the Treat of Paris and led directly to the War of 1812). \n\nSecond, under the 14th Amendment and the Indian Voting Rights Act of 1924, Native Americans HAVE had voting rights (became universal due to some state laws in 1957). Being able to vote in State and Federal elections, including legislative elections. \n\nWhile limited, there are 5 members of the House that are Native American (3 GOP, 2 Dem).\n\nThen you gotta figure out how to GET commissioners (if you go that route) are you getting one from each nation? Per X# of nations? 1-2 per State? How do you handle bigger nations stepping on smaller ones?\n\nThen, the House has to deal with more non-voting members when what they need is more VOTING members with smaller districts (which is a whole different discussion, but would get more minority groups represented). Not more special interests groups yammering for limited attention.", "According to most of the treaties in the United States, Native American tribal nations are just that: nations.  They have ceded foreign relations to the United States, but they are not part of the states whose territory borders them, even if it surrounds them.  For instance, Highway Patrol officers do not have jurisdiction to enter tribal lands to make arrests, conduct searches, or serve warrants.  FBI agents have limited jurisdiction, in consultation with tribal authorities.  \n    \nThat said, states often blithely ignore these rules when they think they can get away with it.  For instance, there was an Attorney General in Kansas some time ago that raided stores on reservation land because they supposedly weren't collecting state sales or liquor taxes -- which they aren't obligated to do, of course.  His excuse was that they were accessible from the interstate, which had the right of way leased from the tribe, and therefore through some mental gymnastics were part of Kansas. \n   \nSo, should they have rights in the lands stolen from them and/or ceded to them?  Certainly.  Is it realistic to expect that people with vested interests will grant or respect those rights?  No.", "I am indigenous. Outside of the procedural/statutory ambiguities and mistakes in your post, I want to focus on the fundamentals.\n\nIn my experience, Native Americans want nothing to do with the governments of municipalities and states. This is because our leverage and autonomy is greater from the tribal level. We are \"sovereign\" meaning we supercede the laws and statutes of local, county and state authorities. In general, the federal government does not want conflict with us, although the BIA takes different forms under each POTUS.\n\nAll that to say - going from a councilor position in a tribe to a county commissioner is, effectively, a serious demotion. There is far less leverage to be wielded at that level.\n\nI hope this helps.", "The Nordics have a group called the Sami. They vary a bit between the Norwegians, Swedes, and Finns, but they have their own parliament. They also elect the said parliament proportionally so no gerrymandering and no weird elections, just party X gets Y% of the votes so they get Y% of the seats. They are doing quite well for themselves. They get into arguments at times of course, but are far better off than many indigenous peoples in North America.\n\nI like that idea. \n\nImportantly, they have a general overarching parliament not just one for each reserve or parish. A few hundred or a couple of thousand natives on a reserve is not economically strong or especially interesting. Individual skyscrapers have more people than that. It is hard to build things with economies of scale or to have people interested in running for office or all kinds of logistical things needed in a modern system which brings about the prosperity and effectiveness they provide, even if you use indigenous principles to help bring them about. It can also help to provide a kind of clear voice you can negotiate with. If you tell people in British Columbia that the Wetsuweten elected chiefs agrees to something and the hereditary chiefs do not, what opinion should you have of that split? Is it legitimate to go against the hereditary chiefs to build a pipe?

Do we create an extra council in Congress to veto bills? If we gave tribal nations more veto power it would just heavily weigh down our current process, and our current process is bogged down as is, so it would more slog things for the rest of us than really empower tribes. \n\nDo we create a cabinet of Indian affairs? We kinda already have that with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and it really doesn't do much. Its also worth noting that most tribes prioritize in getting land rights, not promises that the government can give them. Independent autonomy is often placed of higher importance than participation in the US political system. \n\nOn the flip side of that, tribes have been very active and successful in working with state governments, which arguably progresses at a much faster rate than the federal government. I think its more realistic to lobby state governments for economic relief to improve the conditions of tribes.\n\nTwo ideas for reparations at a state and federal level; the federal government could allocate 1% of military funding to tribal reservations. The idea being that since the military was used for expansionism, a piece of the military has to go back to the descendants of those who were harmed. 1% seems reasonable because that's the percentage amount of indigenous people living in the US today. \n\nRealistically though, I think tribes could successfully lobby their state governments to subsidize remote work salaries (particularly call centers) on tribal lands. That way indigenous citizens don't have to worry about lack of work, it guarantees revenue can be brought to economically deprived areas, companies could pay higher wages thanks to this, and states help alleviate the unemployment problem that has been long lasting in the state. \n\nAnother political empowerment tool is making Oklahoma and New Mexico the first primary states in federal elections. It's largely agreed that Iowa is a bad first state, but most also agree that first states need to be rural, so that there's more reliance on grassroots volunteers rather than whomever can buy the most adspace in the beginning of the election races (Bloomberg would've steamrolled Obama if the first state were New York). Oklahoma, much more diverse than Iowa, has a high native American population with about 10% of the state residents living on tribal lands. In New Mexico, 100,000 Navajos live there. New Mexico also has a high number of Hispanics, which also better represents the country than Iowa or Nevada. \n\nIowa gets a massive amount of sugar subsidies for being the first primary state. Oklahoma and New Mexico are far better reflections of the rest of the country, and indigenous voices would be greatly elevated if they were the first primary states.  This wouldn't even require an act of congress, just a reordering of states by either parties.\n\nEdit: not ministry of Indian affairs, Bureau of Indian Affairs.", "Possibly the worst idea I\u2019ve heard on the sub.

I don\u2019t see the UK giving priority/disproportionate representation to ethnic picts.  I don\u2019t see the Japanese government giving disproportionate governance to Ainu people.  We have possibly the most spoiled indigenous culture of any nation that partook in colonialism(nearly all of them) and if we keep entertaining delusions of their exceptionalism we end up with more insufferable debates.  The past is the past and the US government has done vastly more then other nations to accommodate the people we conquered.  It\u2019s nearing the point where many non-indigenous family lines have deep cultural and ancestral connections to the land they live on, some whose families have spent more consecutive time on their land(typically rural folks) then any Native American.", "it really depends on how well integrated &amp; accepted Native tribe members are within the larger \"host\" community. If statutes &amp; social impediments were erected to prevent social mobility &amp; intermingling and even marriage, then their communities deserve more autonomy and more funding. But if much of their native people have mixed &amp; moved away from tribal lands representation &amp; even special funding &amp; programs/scholarships/internships may be only benefiting a small pocket or minority, which may be unfair to those of mixed background, or those whose families are not officially on tribal registries.", "Rights in the government of their own reservations, but nothing extra elsewhere.", "So you want positive discrimination, essentially.\n\nThat sounds like a terrible idea.", "It seems to me that EITHER the U.S. should actually treat tribes/nations as independent states with their own borders and sovereignty, OR representation should be equal and the state multicultural.\n\nExpanded rights in government seems like the worst of both worlds, to me; it's anti-democratic but also assimilationist.", "Can you explain what exactly a \"resident commissioner\" is, because you've mentioned it several times.", "I'm their own, yes. Which they already do AFAIK. \n\nHow can land not be within the country but within a state? Every state is part of the country. And state governments don't make treaties with foreign nations.", "&gt; By this i mean should they get any special representation, voices, higher autonomy, their our autonomous counties or states etc. \n\nYou're actually referencing multiple different concepts here.\n\n\"Special representation\" is vague, but any representation that would give them more weight than an American citizen is not going to fly, nor should it in a democracy.\n\n\"Higher autonomy\" could certainly be argued, but specifics are important. They have their own countries. Higher autonomy is certainly something their countries could argue for. But that wouldn't be the same as greater autonomy within the US government, which again, sounds like it would be giving them special privileges or additional rights. There are some few of those that exist, but they're not popular on the whole, and trying to expand that would likely be very harmful.", "Ideally, no general law, and no Constitutional right should address any group of people at all. Rights inhere in all and only individual people. Groups of people have *powers*. Powers can be taken away by the people. Rights can never be taken away, only either recognized or violated.\n\nWhen you write a law or Constitutional Amendment, it should be worded in such a way that it is a contract between the government and the individual person, i.e. without regard to any group they happen to be a member of.\n\nNow I know what you are thinking. The ideal principle leaves us open to the failures of human beings to implement it. That is so true. The ideal situation involves a strong judiciary with high quality appointees that will make equitable decisions that protect the minority from the majority. Currently the only minority being protected is the rich and the property-owning.\n\nBut we should resist the temptation to correct these failing in other ways. Inevitably, a day will come when we want the system to work *in principle*, and it needs to be able to allow the good and the decent to be enabled.", "While I appreciate your use of the word 'should', I immediately consider that: if 'natives' have control of their own government, they have more-or-less whatever rights they see fit to grant themselves, and such a question would read more like: 'should non-natives have diminished rights in government'; alternatively, if they do not, there seems little likelihood of any genuine expansion of their rights. \n\nBy 'a native land that isn\u2019t within any other county but is within a state. it has its own charter/constitution and leadership and can create laws and ordinances', do you refer to what would be termed a 'Bantustan'?", "No. They should actually have absolutely no say in what happens at all, since they fought, and lost. Repeatedly. Them having almost exclusive gambing rights is way more than ample compensation for them. Cant think of another time in history where a nation; got there asses whooped, continued to try to to rebel while not learning any new battle tactics at all, get government gifted land after the fact, n still cry. And they always fail to mention that tribes that supported america during the revolution, are treated like brothers. Bc they cant accept their ancestors were actually really not that clever. Like lol they were scalping each other plus stealing land and goods long before the white man showed up. \n\nEvery time a native cries about stolen land, remind them they are perfectly welcome to try n take it back. LOL", "No. Nobody should have anything \u201cspecial\u201d. That applies to all ethnicities, groups or religions.", "I\u2019m absolutely for expanded rights. Technically they\u2019re sovereign nations, but the US breaks treaties/rules so often that the status isn\u2019t respected.\n\nI\u2019m an internationalist and generally against the idea of many nations, as I believe nationality is divisive; but I believe at the end of the day they should be given the right of self determination that natives have been denied for so long.", "No. In fact native Americans should be stripped of anything that separates them from every other American citizen. The whole idea of Indian reservations and independent nations rights is a TERRIBLE idea and should never have been granted. When you're conquered your conquered. There should be no special dispensation for history's losers.", "Here are some of my ideas; \n\nThere's a few things i mean by this:\n\n- instead of having reservations as a separate layer of government from the main state\u2192&gt; county\u2192 township/city structure, should they be incorporated parallel to counties. i feel as though the current way they are organized is really weird and complicates things because you can be living on the same tribal land but belong to different counties or even completely different states. this is why i think tribal lands should be entities alongside counties within a single state (not spanning multiple). but they should also have some lore autonomy. I know some lands would be very small and completely fit within a county. but others like Navajoland would be massive.\n\n\n- the other way native civic rights can be expanded is through special representative seats. state legislatures can create special seats within their assemblies or even senate where tribes with significant populations (or even all tribes) can send a representation. or it can be split between regions like all tribes in northern california have one and all tribes in the Sierra Nevada region have another. these representatives can be full voting members, or limited voting members like some commonwealth residents to Congress; they can sit and vote in committees but not the main floor. these seats can be taken from the current existing numbers or be additional seats that are adde (with is better i feel)", "Yes, indigenous peoples should have representation in state and national governments the world over automatically ('natives' as a term has an unfortunate history), otherwise their rights will continue to be ignored, and they will continue to live in horrifying poverty.\n\nEqually, it should be declared by statute that the discovery of remains or other archaeological evidence which pre-dates living indigenous populations does not invalidate their status or have any bearing on land claims or indigenous rights. \n\nThere is a vital part of human arcological history which tribes all over the world feel compelled to cover up lest it be used against them (and they're right, it will).", "I believe that Republicans' view is that they should not, to the point that they believe the Indian Child Welfare Act--which basically makes it marginally harder for state courts to award custody of Native American kids to non-Native American families, due to a long history of Native American families being broken up--is unconstitutional racial discrimination."]}]
