A few data journalists are discussing a \u201crealignment\u201d by which working-class voters of all races align with the Republican Party while Democrats retain more highly educated non-White voters. Such a result would be a devastating loss to Democrats. Unless large numbers of swing-state White voters replaced the lost Black and Hispanic voters in the Democratic coalition, Biden would almost certainly lose in November.\n\nThe question of whether this is actually happening is complicated. And the answer is, for now, somewhat elusive. There are two competing arguments. First, that the realignment crowd is either correct or close enough that Democrats are facing a potentially catastrophic fall campaign. Second, that there are some notable changes afoot, and those changes comport with voters sorting along education levels. But it\u2019s far from a realignment and Biden has time and resources to regain ground, along with an opponent who will likely help him do so. Indeed, from this vantage, the whole debate is reminiscent of the 2022 \u201cred wave\u201d that never made it to shore.\n\nFrancis Wilkinson takes them in turn [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-31/black-and-hispanic-voters-aren-t-moving-to-trump-in-droves-yet).", "my street had 4-5 families that all had Biden bumper stickers and or flags out in the yard as of yet this year no signs of any sigs or stickers.

For instance, Trump's call to \"Liberate Michigan!\" amidst COVID-19 restrictions, which was followed by plots against Governor Gretchen Whitmer, exemplifies this pattern. His refusal to unequivocally condemn the neofascist group, the Proud Boys, instead telling them to \"stand back and stand by\" during a presidential debate, has also been highlighted as an example.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's rhetoric has been linked to increased threats and violence against individuals and groups he opposes. For example, after accusing General Mark Milley of treason, Trump hinted at a historically severe punishment for such acts, potentially inciting violence against Milley. Similar rhetoric was directed at news organizations like NBC News and MSNBC, which he accused of committing treason, a charge that historically carries the death penalty. \n\nThese instances are seen as ways Trump communicates to his followers about who his enemies are, sometimes leading to threats or acts of violence against those individuals or entities.\n\nThe underlying concern with such statements is not just the immediate threat of violence but also the broader impact on democratic norms and the safety of individuals. The discussions and analyses suggest that this pattern of rhetoric has contributed to a heightened atmosphere of division and hostility, raising serious concerns about the potential for further violence and the undermining of democratic institutions.", "How long before he posts judges addresses and vaguely suggests someone go and convince the judge he didn't do anything wrong.

Those renewal applications are seeing processing times of up to 16 months.\n\n\u201cEmployers in our states cannot afford to wait until mid-April to know whether their employees will be able to continue working legally,\u201d according to the letter spearheaded by Sens.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(D-Mass.) and\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand\u00a0(D-N.Y.). \u201cThese employers need to be able to plan and operate knowing that their workforce will not be disrupted by abrupt changes in work authorization status.\u201d\n\nWork permits are typically valid for 180 days after expiration if there\u2019s a renewal application pending at US Citizenship and Immigration Services. But processing backlogs extending beyond that six-month period led the agency in 2022 to issue temporary regulations extending the grace period to a year and a half.\n\nThose regulations expired in October\u2014reverting the grace period back to 180 days\u2014yet long wait times have persisted, putting the employment authorization of many immigrants at risk, lawmakers noted. More than 279,000 work permit renewal applications were pending by September 2023, according to the latest figures released by USCIS.\n\n[Read more here. ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/democrats-push-to-expedite-rule-extending-immigrant-work-permits?utm_source=reddit.com&amp;utm_medium=lawdesk)"]}, {"title": "Ronna McDaniel mess shows problem of politics-to-pundit conveyor belt", "description": "", "time": 1711918769.0, "comments": ["\nAs a reminder, this subreddit [is for civil discussion.](/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil)\n\nIn general, be courteous to others.

I knew it was allowed in my neighborhood and I was vaguely aware of some law that said HOA's in Texas couldn't stop you from adding solar panels. While researching solar I found out about Solar Roofs, and while they were more expensive they sounded pretty great. I didn't have to look at ugly solar panels on my roof and it would give me better power generation. Seemed like a pretty good win.\n\nSo I started building up the money and contacting the solar company. I had everything about ready but they sent a sheet saying I must get the HOA's written explicit approval. Didn't seem like a big deal to me so I sent it through. Weirdly enough, they cam back and solar roofs are explicitly prohibited in my neighborhood. Apparently they cannot say no to solar panels _(they try to tell you they just can't be visible from the street which is pretty nonsense)_, since a solar roof isn't a solar panel they can so to that.\n\nSo thanks HOA, you made the neighborhood uglier I guess by having another house with large ugly solar panels on it.", "\"Solar Opposition Groups\"  what fucking Hell are we living in.
