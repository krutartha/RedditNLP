[{"title": "Moving forward on Israel/Palestine posts, and other moderation concerns", "description": "Hi all. Posting this on Sunday night EST so this isn't mistaken for an April Fool's Thing (sorry, GMT folks).\n\nTwo things as we enter Q2 of 2024:\n\n1) **Israel/Palestine**.   Big issues with this topic in particular, and it's a sitewide problem and one that no single sub or mod can possibly fix.  What I can do, for here at least, is make this a place that is safe and free to discuss *without hate speech* and *without violating sitewide rules*.  The latter, we have no choice in.  The former, the level of discourse required by the site is lower than the level of discourse we should be able to expect when talking about such a volatile topic.\n\nI see a few paths forward, and would love anyone's thoughts:\n\na) Maintain the moratorium - if it ain't broke, etc.\n\nb) Strict moderation of the topic - basically what we had before, as much as \"I wonder how long before this gets locked\" became a thing.\n\nc) Stricter moderation on the topic - allow the posts, but be very quick to remove anything inflammatory.\n\nd) A \"megathread\" of sorts of Israel/Palestine reads that is heavily moderated or otherwise doesn't have long back-and-forths.\n\nd) Something else I'm not thinking of.\n\nThere are no good answers here, in part because anti-semites don't care as long as they can boost their hate, anti-Arab/Muslim people don't care as long as they can boost their hate, and a lot of people who aren't outright hateful still repeat the boosted stuff believing incorrectly that it *isn't* hateful.  Like I said, bigger problem than here.\n\nThe only option not on the table is to allow the hate speech to linger.  That's not going to happen.  Anything else, though, I'm all ears.\n\n(Do not debate it here in this post.  If you have to ask if it's hate speech, it's probably hate speech.)\n\n2) **Moderation in General**: Traditionally, the rules on the sidebar have been less hard-and-fast and more \"hard suggestions.\"  The predominant approach over the years was a hands-off one.  Is that still working for people?\n\nThanks for making this place one of the more interesting places on the site.", "time": 1711932620.0, "comments": ["My vote is to maintain the moratorium on this radioactive topic.", "Do you / the mod team have the resources to carefully monitor the Israel / Palestine posts?

It seems, that in the same way that the public of the 1920s were told by the press of the day to embrace euthanasia as a way of dealing with the tens of thousands of people burdened with post-Spanish flu viral sequelae like epilepsy, parkinsons and encephalitis, the public of the 2020s are messaged by the press of today that assisted dying is good, the disabled are faking it and long covid doesn't real.\n\nThis article examines a recent instance of this pro-eugenics astroturfing showing up in the biggest non-tabloid UK newpaper, The Times.", "It is interesting to observe the vehemence in some quarters to even the suggestion that it would be sufficient to make the various accoutrements sufficient to end one's life readily available along with instructions for their use. For a hard core, nothing short of death-by-doctor is acceptable. \n\nThey like to play on such words as 'dignity', and take issue with the fact that the few persons incapable of killing themselves in any way are also incapable of feeding themselves; but they cannot point out how dying of a drug overdose - as any washed-up primadonna in a motel room might do - is 'dignified', but death by starvation - as famously achieved by Bobby Sands, is 'undignified', and grossly so.\n\nNow I think this is all rather interesting. Something crucial to this drive for the 'good death' - euthanasia - lies, not in the ready availability of suicide technics, or exculpation for the mailman who delivers you them, but in a member of the medical profession administering death by needle-point (not gunpoint; they do not like my alternative of a member of the armed forces, our paid experts in such matters, coming round to do the deed - the medical profession must be besmirched).\n\nIf I were of a conspiratorial bent, I would make hay; I must simply content myself with pointing out a peculiarity of personality among the set angling for 'assistance in dying'."]}, {"title": "The quiet disappearance of the safe deposit box", "description": "", "time": 1711917589.0, "comments": ["\nRemember that TrueReddit is a place to engage in **high-quality and civil discussion**.
