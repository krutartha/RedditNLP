It claims the vast majority of deaths in the conflict are civilians, and is frequently used to justify claims of genocide against Israel. The current number stands at around 32k Dead, of whom half are minors. \n\nHere's the thing, the number is wrong. I think people directly quoting the number are making a mistake. It's wrong. It's obviously wrong. But, the specific way it's wrong is awkward for everyone. \n\nThe reason why is this. The GMH Talley is accurately tracking confirmed deaths. Most of the people on the list (there's an actual list of names) are dead. It's just undercounting the actual death toll.\n\nIt's awkward for Hamas because: \n\nHamas and \"resistance\" deaths are not being accurately tracked in the page. The list is exclusively composed of people reported to the ministry or who ended up in the hospital. There's basically no evidence Hamas/PIJ is telling the GHM accurate casualty tallies. \n\nSoldier/terrorists lost behind the lines, killed in airstrikes, buried in collapsed tunnels, are not being added to the list. The 7-8k Missing category that the GHM mentions is probably disproportionately fighting age males. \n\nOne of the clearest indicators of this is the fact that terrorists killed during the Oct. 7 offensive do not seem to show up on the list. We know that between 500 and 2000 fighters died in \"67 Israel\" during the offensive, but the early list didn't \"jump\" at the start with fight-age male losses. \n\nThe incentive for \"the Resistance\" is obvious. They plan to claim victory/they fought off Israel after the war ends. It's the same reason they publish their absurdly fake Talley of Israeli casualties and the videos of RPG ambushes that don't show impact. They can't honestly admit to the Palastinian people that 2/3rds of their battalions have been smashed. \n\nIt's awkward for Israel because:\n\nIsrael actually has killed an absolute fuck ton of civilians. The ratio isn't quite as lopsided as the GMH Talley suggests. But 12k dead Palastinian children is a lot. The evidence that they've killed so many people is extremely well documented and the attempts to deny it or claim it's staged are really emberassing lies. \n\nThe thing is, Israel is probably aware of this. They do go around claiming the GMH is false, but they can't actually admit that the real reason why is that it's just incomplete. \n\nTechnically speaking, if Israel actually has killed 10k-15k resistance fighters and 25k-30k civilians, this isn't a *good* Soldier-Civilian death ratio. The US broadly achieved 2:1 in the seige of Mosul, so Israel with 1:1.5 - 1:3 still raises a bunch of uncomfortable questions. But, the fact they can't admit this leaves them open to the GMH charge of something ludicrous like 1:6 or worse. A 1:2 ratio is an exceedingly bloody war, but within defensible bounds. A 1:6 ratio is a much more credible genocide allegation. \n\nConclusion:\n\nWe're left with the Gaza Ministry number because it's the only Talley of the dead that's detailed and data driven. It's not a lie, but it should not be taken as a representative. It's still useful as an absolute floor of deaths. Still, I don't think people should be using it to actually discuss the death ratio in Gaza.", "time": 1711932842.0, "comments": ["/u/WinterinoRosenritter (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1bss5t1/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_the_gaza_health_ministry/), in /r/DeltaLog.\n\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)", "Slight correction (depending on who you\u2019re sourcing): many are in agreement that far more died in Mosul ([and Iraq as a whole](https://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/ten-years/)) than originally reported. 174,000:39,900 civilian:combatant for the whole war.\n\nUrban warfare is impossible to avoid civilians.

Neither of those makes sense from a logistics or intelligence standpoint in warfare. \n\nAlso how can the death toll be accurately estimated in a state of warfare? Are there active cleanup teams? Is there a place where people can actively report KIAs? What about other civilian casualties? Does dropping bombs on infrastructure and homes displacing civilians, and inuring them not count as genocide?", "Only counting confirmed deaths doesn't make the tally wrong. Isn't that pretty standard practice? It's the health ministry, they aren't gathering the types of data or have the statistical knowledge to even attempt to guess what the true death toll is. Its they attempted that they would almost certainly be wrong. That kind of estimate normally happen after the events are over. \n\nAlso do they claim to count casualties of Hamas fighters/terrorists on 10/7? The fact that those deaths aren't included in seems immaterial to me.\n\nYou are calling the tally \"wrong\", but it's not wrong, you just want a different type of data.

So at a minimum you'd expect random civilian deaths to be equally distributed between men and women, or slanted towards men.\n\n\nAnd finally the number pretty much went up linearly since the start of the war, +-15%. There's never been a day with fewer than 85% of the average and never a day with more than 115% of the average.

Hamas is a resistance group. It is a civilians resistance group. Unlike the IOF or the US military who actually have registered fighters. On October 7 Hamas fighters breached the wall that cages the people of Gaza. Once that wall was breached it\u2019s estimated that 1,000 men exited Gaza. Many were obviously Hamas but many were simply men who had never been outside the wall before and joined in the chaos. This doesn\u2019t mean they \u201cjoined Hamas\u201d, they just breached the wall. Hamas does regularly release names of their members who have died. I couldn\u2019t tell you if they release all of them.\n\nAs for the numbers, no one seriously doubts the numbers of dead as reported by Gaza\u2019s health ministry. The important thing to understand is that Israel holds a population registry of Gaza. It has the names, addresses and phone numbers of every person in Gaza. They are able effectively to keep track of everyone in Gaza. If Israel doubts the numbers, it can check its own registry. \n\nThe other difficulty with counting civilians vs Hamas is that when men have lost everything, when they have watched their entire families being murdered, watched their cities destroyed, watch all schools and hospitals destroyed, what life is left? To become a fighter in Gaza only means to start fighting and resisting. It\u2019s completely different than joining the IOF.", "[removed]", "They are probably the only ones with access to that information. Unless Israel lets other agencies in, all we have is the GHM's only take as a source.", "AFAIK, the gaza MOH is not counting the folks killed inside the 67 border ...just as they aren't counting the West bank killings. (Which , since Oct 7 is also in the hundreds)", "The ratio or \"amount\" of death is not the qualifier for genocide. \n\nBoth us and British forces killed 5 million German civilians and no one calls that genocide. I understand that this is before the legal definition was even defined (ironically, as a result of crimes against Jews), but we can still look back on history and decide whether a campaign fits the definition.\n\nWe rightly call the Armenian genocide a genocide, even though it occured before the legal definition.\n\nHowever, we do not call the bombing of Hiroshima one, because it simply wasn't.\n\nAbsolutely brutal? Yes? As massacre? Yes. But last I checked, the German and Japanese populations are doing just fine, because the goal of erasing them from existence was never the intent of those campaigns. So the fire bombing of Dresden, or literal nukes dropped on dense civilian populations are rightly not called genocide, because that word has very specific meaning.\n\nContrast this with the actual intent of Hamas, and their actual actions, and you will find, at least, the party who wishes to do just that in this conflict.\n\nYou should take them at their word instead of splitting hairs over death ratio. And to add, it is without a doubt a war crime to imbedd military operations behind civilians. So it's hard make the accusation that Israel is even responsible for these deaths apart from the fact that it's their munitions causing them. By the same token, if one throws a child into a highway, we aren't going to blame the drivers for the horror that unfolds. That the responsibility of the person (or people) who put that child in harm's way, which is why imbedding military operations among civilians is strictly prohibited. There isn't even a gray area here. In fact, civilian targets are literally fair game as soon as these rules are violated. So what Israel is doing is debatable, there simply is no debate about what Hamas does.\n\nEven if we consider the claimed famine unfolding. Sure, Isreal bears some blame, but again, those aren't Israeli citizens suffering. Theoretically, it's Hamas that is supposed to have some contingency for their citizens under the possibility of an invasion. Is anyone surprised that the people who would put command centers under UNRWA aren't exactly keen on stockpiling food for their people in a conflict they knew would result in exactly what's happening? And given the fact that aid has been repeatedly used as a tool to recruit terrorists into various conflicts all throughout the middle east, and that Hamas definitely uses this tactic, it's not even in Isreals best interest to give them that leverage if self preservation means anything.\n\nHold the right people accountable here.

Everyone warned Israel and they moved their military away from the threat, then we're made to wait a long time before responding. Netanytahu already had the Gaza invasion plans laid out and much of the evidence prefabricated. What Hamas did was terrible, but what netanytahu and the far right did to both Israel and Palestine is far worse.", "The amount of dead Hamas fighters isn't separated from the total. 32k is the total, including both combatants and non-combatants. \n\nThe Gazan Health Ministry claims most of the deaths are women and children, but it's pretty clear that their breakdown of that total is fabricated. \nFor more on that, read [this great article](https://www.thejc.com/news/world/hamas-casualty-numbers-are-statistically-impossible-says-data-science-professor-rc0tzedc) by a statistician, breaking down exactly why the MoH breakdown of that 32k doesn't add up.\n\nIf what Israel claims is true, that means that there are 12k dead Hamas and 20k more dead civilians, or a ratio of 1:1.6. However, even if you don't believe Israel's claims, Hamas themselves have admitted to losing 6k fighters, so according to Hamas the ratio is 1:4.3. \n\nYou claim that a ratio of 1:1.5 isn't great, but I beg to differ. Considering how third party estimates now put the amount of Hamas fighters lost around 10k, that would be a ratio of 1:2.2, **which is significantly better than expected.**\n\nIt's true that out of Israel's track record, this war is by far their worst. Previous wars, including wars in Gaza, had ratio closer to 1:1 or even less. But considering the scale of this war, Israel is doing far better than any other western army would. \n\nThe UN estimates the typical ratio is 9:1.  \nPretty much every other instance of urban guerilla warfare in recent history had a significantly higher civilian to combatant ratio.\n\nThe battle of Mosul reportedly had a ratio of 5:1. The War in Afghanistan had a total of 4:1, and Iraq war 3:1. The battle of Aleppo had a ratio of 10:1. The Battle of Raqqa is unsure, but according to some estimates it may have had a ratio of up to 20:1-30:1.  \nAs for cases were there was no care by the sieging party for civilians, the ratios were very high. The siege of Sarajevo had a ratio of anywhere from 3:1-10:1. And according to some estimates, the battle of Grozny had a ratio of up to 50:1.\n\nNow, even if you only take Hamas' word on the number of combatant casualties, the 4:1 ratio would still be around the ballpark of similar urban battles / regime change wars, such as the US' war in Afghanistan or the battle of Mosul. However, the more you approach the Israeli estimate, which seems more accurate (although also probably somewhat exaggerated), the more it becomes clear that the Israeli campaign has a far lower ratio than expected.\n\nSources:\n\n[UN estimate](https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14904.doc.htm)\n\nMosul: [1](https://library.icrc.org/library/docs/DOC/irrc-912-cotter.pdf) [2](https://airwars.org/) [3](https://www.losservatorio.org/en/civlians-in-conflict/reports/item/923-the-challenges-of-urban-battles-a-lesson-from-mosul)\n\nAfghanistan: [1](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar)  [2](https://unama.unmissions.org/) [3](https://www.hrw.org/asia/afghanistan)\n\nIraq: \n[1](https://www.iraqbodycount.org/database/) \n[2](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/summary)\n[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War)\n\nAleppo: [1](https://www.outlookindia.com/international/ukraine-crisis-syrian-war-survivors-relive-memories-of-aleppo-seige-news-186927) [2](https://www.sams-usa.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/202205-SAMS-A-heavy-price-to-pay_Final_Version_En-1.pdf) [3](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/10/syria-un-must-act-to-end-onslaught-aimed-at-purging-civilians-from-eastern-aleppo/)\n\nRaqqa: \n[1](https://airwars.org/news/raqqa-amnesty-airwars/) [2](https://www.rand.org/pubs/articles/2022/civilian-casualties-lessons-from-the-battle-for-raqqa.html)\n[3](https://apnews.com/hub/syria)\n[4](https://theintercept.com/2019/04/25/coalition-airstrikes-in-raqqa-killed-at-least-1600-civilians-more-than-10-times-u-s-tally-report-finds/)\n\nSarajevo: \n[1](https://www.amazon.com/End-War-Richard-Holbrooke/dp/037550057X) \n[2](https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bosnia) \n[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia) \n\nGrozny: \n[1](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/Russia.htm) [2](https://academic-accelerator.com/encyclopedia/casualties-of-the-second-chechen-war) [3](https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/massacres-civilians-chechnya.html)", "Hamas could release names of people who they killed or who died of natural causes.

I do not have a clear argument here.\n\n\n&gt;\u00a0The GMH Talley is accurately tracking confirmed deaths. Most of the people on the list (there's an actual list of names) are dead. It's just undercounting the actual death toll.\n\n\nYou do not know that, and you can not know that and that's probably the main claim I am going to make here. While statistics can be used to contradict the results with high probability, nobody can tell what is the reason behind the fake deathtoll other than the GHM. Whatever you come up with is at best a guess and at worst a conspiracy.\n\n\n&gt;\u00a0Israel actually has killed an absolute fuck ton of civilians. The ratio isn't quite as lopsided as the GMH Talley suggests. But 12k dead Palastinian children is a lot. The evidence that they've killed so many people is extremely well documented and the attempts to deny it or claim it's staged are really emberassing lies.\n\n\nWhat evidence? We do not have any evidence regarding the total death toll or the total children death toll. We only have evidence that this war is intense and many died, but nothing about how many died. I disagree with saying it's a lie unless you show me that evidece (specifically about the ratio of children, I think there's practically 0 evidence that even suggests this is true).\n\n\n&gt; The thing is, Israel is probably aware of this. They do go around claiming the GMH is false, but they can't actually admit that the real reason why is that it's just incomplete.\n\n\nNobody is a mind reader. Israel can not responsibly say what makes the GMH lie about the death toll. As I said before, this would be a conspiracy.\n\n\n&gt; Technically speaking, if Israel actually has killed 10k-15k resistance fighters and 25k-30k civilians, this isn't a\u00a0good\u00a0Soldier-Civilian death ratio. The US broadly achieved 2:1 in the seige of Mosul, so Israel with 1:1.5 - 1:3 still raises a bunch of uncomfortable questions. But, the fact they can't admit this leaves them open to the GMH charge of something ludicrous like 1:6 or worse. A 1:2 ratio is an exceedingly bloody war, but within defensible bounds. A 1:6 ratio is a much more credible genocide allegation.\n\n\nOk so let's follow your premise. There are multiple problems here\n\n\n1. There's no reason to expect Israel army to be more efficient/profrssional than the US.\n\n\n2. As others mentioned, the death toll in Mosul is close to what US reports it. What Israel reports is 15k Hamas out of 30k civilians, which is 1:1 ratio.\n\n\n3. This war is different. Israel can easily claim they are in far more danger than the US was while fighting in Mosul (Gaza is in walking distance from Israel) and therefore are less capable of being as careful, especially at the first phase of the war.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\u00a0We're left with the Gaza Ministry number because it's the only Talley of the dead that's detailed and data driven. It's not a lie, but it should not be taken as a representative. It's still useful as an absolute floor of deaths. Still, I don't think people should be using it to actually discuss the death ratio in Gaza.\n\n\nI also want to conclude I mostly agree with this, even though I'm not as confident as you that the total death toll is not a lie, I agree that it can be used. Although, I disagree that the distribution (children, women, men) is reasonable at all and there are statistical facts that contradicts this.", "In previous wars, they'd rely on the hospital system to tally up the number of deaths, but with almost all of them destroyed by the IDF, it makes tallying deaths way more difficult, with the death toll actually potentially being significantly higher because of those dead under the rubble.  Also the IDF also uses the Gaza Health Ministry numbers and checks against them.", "There's two way to see this:\n\nEither you try to understand how much each side is lying, which would end up being extremely hard, subject to controversy, and very dubious\n\nOr you compare it to similar conflict. (Other insurgency in the ME, or in the world, ratio of fighter/civilians deaths to be expected), but that also depends on how you compare.\n\nNeither will give you realistic results. However, with Hamas estimated numbers (around 30k-40k before the war), you would expect 4-5 times that in civilian casualties if Israel fought like the syrians did (100k civilians casualties)\n\nIf they did the same that the russian did in Chechnya (around 13 000 insurgents), you would end up with, depending on the sources: 5-40 times that number of deaths (the 30-40 is more likely, being based on census, the other is confirmed deaths), so a bit over a million\n\n\nIf they fight like americans did, you would expect the numbers of civilians casualties to be similar, but given how fortified Hamas is, most likely, it would be more civilians than fighters anyway (though, in a similar order of magnitude (Irak: 200k insurgents killed or taken prisonners, civilians deaths toll of around 400-600k, though most of it isn't invasion deathtoll, but excess mortality, not the exact same, especially over longer periods)", "&gt;\n\nTechnically speaking, if Israel actually has killed 10k-15k resistance fighters and 25k-30k civilians, this isn't a good Soldier-Civilian death ratio.

A 1:6 ratio is a much more credible genocide allegation. \n\nIf Israel has actually killed 10-15k resistance fighters... lets consider that figure.  In combat ratios involving explosives, casualty ratios (wounded to dead) is typically around 3:1.  For modern militaries with medical treatment immediately available it's 10:1, less modern and you sink back towards the 3:1.  Bullet heavy combats can sink lower, 2:1 even, (with it even below 1:1 with close quarters firearm combat in enclosed spaces).  But for bombing, 3:1.\n\nProblem is, Hamas had 20-25k members pre-October 7th.  So... who is fighting?  How is anyone left alive?  \n\nIsrael's numbers are not consitent.", "I think the question is who is to blame for the civilian deaths.

All you have to look at for evidence that their numbers are completely fabricated is look at the al-Ahli hospital blast. They immediately reported hundreds more deaths than there actually were and Hamas blamed it on an Israeli bomb, which was false of course. Seriously how is anyone blindly trusting a terrorist organization\u2019s numbers of civilian deaths? And don\u2019t you think the civilians they themselves shoot would also be included in any semi-accurate count?", "The Israeli goal is to turn attention off the very obvious fact that they\u2019re massacring civilians (which they pride themselves in, as contradicting themselves and lying is never an issue for them) and to talk about math rather than about the fact that they\u2019re a militarized dystopia populated by psychopaths. This kind of questions raised by op, although probably in good faith, are just biting right into it.\n\n\nPalestinians don\u2019t have the luxury to lie.

For this argument I\u2019m assuming normal family suburban homes. Not some giant compound that uses extreme amounts of energy. I understand that those may have nearer term break even points. \n\n\nMy point: When people make the case that solar \u201csaves them money\u201d. They do overly basic math. \n\nExample: I spent $20k on the system. My bill used to be $100/mo and now it\u2019s $0/mo. So I break even 200 months aka 16 years. \n\nWhat I feel like is unfairly left out of the equation is the opportunity cost of the $20k. I think it\u2019s fair to debate where that money would have been otherwise (I.e. not in solar panels), but for debate I think it\u2019s fair to assume that money would be in the S&amp;P500 or VTSAX or equivalent.  When you do this math, you\u2019re very unlikely to ever break even or if you do it\u2019s 40+ years out.

While also factoring in opportunity cost. I have no way to validate the prices they claim or their savings on electricity but it seems like for some there\u2019s a solid case to be made. Thanks!!\n\nYou should still be factoring in opportunity cost when you evaluate your system from a financial standpoint.

So our solar effectively cost $16k. \n\nOur old electric bill averaged $250 a month if you account for highs and lows so $3k a year. Our new electric bill is $500 a year. So we will get our moneys worth from solar in 6.5 years.

I don't know the specifics, but a quick google search says it's 30% for federal and I see that some states also give tax breaks on top of that. Second, $100/month? That's very low.

If you pay 20k for the system and 100for electricity it\u2018s going to take 16 years until solar pays for itself. \n2. you assume that people use their savings. Imagine using a loan and investing the 20k into the stock market. Completely different equation.\n3. It does save them money. They spend less on their energy bill. That\u2018s factually correct. \n\nAre there investments that would yield a higher return? Absolutely. If you bought S&amp;P500 you\u2018d have a higher return.

It\u2019s a home upgrade, it\u2019s a hedge against utility costs and it has a completely different risk profile than the stock market. \n\nRooftop solar is even quite a bit more expensive per watt than utility scale solar.

It would need to be higher to account for the tax paid on liquidating.\n\nThis may be because it\u2019s very sunny where I live, electricity is expensive and for a time rebates were pretty good.\n\nI think you\u2019re right, most people don\u2019t do the maths before they install solar - but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a terrible investment or even a worse one as many people have done the maths. Now, I didn\u2019t factor in the extra interest I paid from not having the cash offsetting my mortgage, so maybe the payback period is slightly longer, electricity prices going up 30% over that time certainly helped it pay back sooner as did generally changing lifestyle increasing overall energy consumption. \n\nThere are other benefits around the general \u201cgreen\u201d idea which aren\u2019t financial.

When I first started looking at solar around 5 years ago panels were like 3 times as expensive and batteries at least 5 times as expensive.

If you live in an area where energy is extraordinarily cheap and in an area where installation would be particularly expensive, perhaps it doesn't pencil out, but in many places it will.\n\nIn my case I have real world experience as I installed a 14 kW system in 2019.\n\n* Cost of system: $34k\n\n* Tax credit: $10k\n\n* Net cost: $24k\n\n*Actual energy savings: $2k/year\n\n* Projected breakeven: 12 years\n\nSo, give or take, my ROI is  2/24 = 8.3% risk-free, tax-free return\n\nYou can't find that ROI for that risk profile anywhere, and that's a fairly long payback because I live in a LCOL state with cheap energy.  In higher cost states the payback period can be as short as half of what mine is.  At the same time that I made my investment in solar, 20 year US Treasuries paid 2%.  Even now, they only pay 4.5%.\n\nYou are right to compare investing $20k in solar against investing $20k in some other way, but I think you'll find that in most jurisdictions in the US with the assist of the federal tax credits, solar is a big win.", "My sister bought solar about 15 years ago, back when prices were much higher.

We have a heat pump.\n\nThe opportunity to run ALL of our needs including transport from just the sun is very alluring! Panels have come down in price so much and the govt grants are so good that our repayment period here is only about 3.5yrs.\n\nThe value added to the property arguably brings that forward to day 1. Also the council tax here is 50% off for 2yrs if you get solar.\n\nFrom what I understand about solar it is far better to get it fitted at the point of use, however the fittings is a large part of the cost which means it is more expensive per kWh to fit on rooftops vs in an open field en masse. That said it makes more sense economically for ME to take the govt grants and benefit quickly from day 1 as well as in the longer term.\n\nOne of the many cool things about this upgrade to the house is that once agile tariffs start in Spain (as seen in the UK already) you could get paid to use electricity from the grid at certain times of day. The battery we get will soak this up as well as let us get paid to charge our car. When the battery can add flex to the grid on these tariffs it can buy low and sell high. Enough of this at scale and \u201cpeaker plants\u201d will be a written into the history books.", "I spent $3,000 on solar (*I admit I got a good deal*). I didn't get a battery because that would have been another ~$10,000 and we couldn't afford it.\n\nOur bill went from ~$400 in Summer to ~$4 in summer, Autumn and Spring the bills have essentially halved, and in Winter we're seeing very little benefit.\n\nAll up we're saving ~$700 per year, meaning after ~4 years it's paid for itself. Even if we double that for the \"opportunity cost\" that means it's an 8-9 year investment. It's part of our house, so 8-9 years is totally fine.", "Your $100 a month electric bill assumption is hilariously low in my experience. I've never had one that low in an apartment, let alone a house.", "They absolutely do overly basic math. I've had this discussion multiple times with people regarding solar. My energy costs go up by about 4x during the winter months compared to the rest of the year. I'm highly unlikely to install a system that is going to provide that amount of energy year round, so I will still be paying an energy bill for the most in demand months. Even if I did install such a system, the overproduction during the rest of the year will be bought back at pennies on the dollar by the PUD.. while I'll be paying for a system that is far in excess of what I'd need for most months.\n\nThey also don't take into account things like snow buildup, roof angles, or so many other things that can impact production. Some calculators do, but most of the time you see far more simplified calculations like your example.\n\nWhat's more, energy costs vary wildly from state to state, and even within states. I live in an area where solar would be ideal to use, but energy costs are some of (if not the) lowest in the nation. Using more realistic math, it would take me something like 30 years to recoup the costs of a solar system that only covered my energy usage during the average spring/summer/fall months. It's actually debatable whether or not I'd ever actually recoup those costs at all during the lifetime of the panels (and my roof).\n\nThe other issue I have with these solar calculations is that they ALWAYS include massive tax benefits that bring the costs down by a huge amount. However - to my mind, that isn't free. Not for our society, at least. That money is coming from somewhere. or it could have been used in another way. When we're talking about an individual level it's probably fine to include them, but I don't feel it's right to skew the numbers by talking about costs after tax deductions when we're talking about community or statewide projects/requirements.\n\nSuffice to say, I'm not going to change your mind.. because you're right.", "You have good points and you're able to provide points that show that you're not just a hater. I'd say that it just depends on your area. Like you showed a 16 year example, but in some areas it can be as quick as 5 years.\n\nThen I'd say that most people don't consider it as a pure investment, but that they are also considering your 4 points. So if I have $20k to invest, maybe it is solar, maybe it isn't. Perhaps I want to diversify my risk. You said that it is a hedge against inflation, so in some areas or in some people's minds, that hedge against inflation is worth it. Like the opportunity cost of being grid dependent could be 100% because of runaway inflation.\u00a0\n\nPersonally, if I had $20k to invest and I had land, then I'd invest it toward going off grid instead of the stock market.\n\nI'd say this way of thinking is kind of like should you DIY a repair for your house/car or hire someone. The opportunity cost of DIY is sometimes \"worth it\" because there *is* a lot of value in knowing how things work and being independent. People who think that they will just hire a professional for everything are prone to get scammed/overpay. We're seeing that now with simple repairs costing hundreds of dollars, but people are completely overwhelmed thinking about fixing it because they have never tried anything like that.\n\nSo overall, my point is that sometimes it is purely economically reasonable to go solar, but that it is a hedge against potential loss. Potential loss can be more devastating than not maximizing returns. Like in 2008 people who were maximizing their returns in the stock market were devastated when they were laid off and didn't have enough money in a boring savings account.\u00a0", "You forget that your cost for electricity will increase over the lifetime of your system. Also you can sell excess power back to the utility.", "There are times of the year and areas where if you stay hooked to the electric grid you can actually \u201csell\u201d electricity back.

We do clean panels in winter and calculated we would have recovered costs  in 7 years. We just expanded to accommodate an EV; that bumped up paid out year to 2028. Still in the 10 year range. We calculate our payback based on how much power we use vs. how much we import and export.\n\nCould we have made more by leaving investment money in place? Sure, but investments are for buying things you value. BTW we did have a panel fail, and it was in the warranty period, so it was a free replacement.", "Why did you buy such an expensive system when you don\u2019t use that much electricity?\n\nThe usual payback for a properly sized system is 3-5 years.", "Your power bill wont be $200/month in 16yrs", "It's possible that prices have changed a lot since I put mine in, but in June 2018 I got a system estimated to produce 6500 kWh/year for $16.4k gross. There were $4k of instant rebates and about $3k in state tax credits I claimed over the next couple years, and $3k of federal credits I carried forward until 2022 when I could actually use them. I have a brokerage account that I keep separate from the rest of my retirement accounts, precisely to do this sort of benchmarking (for robo advisors, or other investment opportunities). I'm only 65% equities, so someone who is 100% in the S&amp;P500 would see solar as a little leas favorable, though someone with higher income (or fewer kids) probably could have used the tax credits immediately.\n\nAnyway, I keep a spreadsheet that models what would happen if the solar money got the same investment returns as my benchmark account, but I used that account to pay my utility bill, and tax bill. I look at actual production, and actual energy prices (and I don't count the $18/month fee that I still pay for my grid connection). I haven't updated it since December, but at that point (5.5 years after the install) the investments were ahead by about $3k. That was when the solar panels had paid themselves back in nominal dollars.\n\nSo, you're definitely correct to care about opportunity cost, but once you do that, if the solar panels ever catch up to the hypothetical investment, no matter how long that takes, then you have to concede that they are a good investment regardless of any environmental considerations. And in my case that will probably happen in the next few years, probably less than 10 years after install.\n\nI'm in upstate NY, so the rebate and tax incentives were probably better than average, though the sunshine is probably worse than average. I'll also add, I got three quotes, and the price per kW installed varied by a factor of two. Had I gone with the most expensive option, it's entirely possible the solar panels would never have caught up to the investment benchmark.", "The problem is the inflated cost of solar in some places. I paid the equivalent of 5k. And my bill went from about $120 a month to $5. In about 45 months the investment is paid. \n\nBut yeah when it cost 20k I can see how it is hard to justify", "I'm not going to do something unless it makes good economic sense. \n\nI've yet to have gotten a quote for home solar that doesn't involve a 20+ year ROI. I would be in my upper 60s age wise, more likely than not living in my current home, and probably by the time it even approached that point, several panels would probably need replacement, even further extending the time to recoup the investment. My local electric rates haven't really fluctuated that much (surprisingly) in the last 5 years. There would have to be a forecast of a huge jump in rates for me to even start to think about the \"what if\". \n\nNow, it \\*might\\* make sense for a utility company to install solar on individual homes in lieu of building out more generating capacity elsewhere. They would have a tremendous amount of purchasing power not available to the individual that would drastically lower the cost. It would be politically more popular, as you would reduce the amount of open land being taken up to build out solar elsewhere. There has been a proposal for a solar farm a couple of miles from my home that has a lot of people up in arms because of the 200+ acres of green space it will occupy. Why not just put an equivalent number of panels on the homes of everyone within a 5-10 mile radius? Yeah, the cost of install is going to be higher (to a point) because you're doing several hundred or thousand individual installs, but you avoid all of the land acquisition, permitting, and legal expense of putting it in one spot.", "My power company offers up to $25k in credits and subsidies based on the system and storage you install as well as grid access to that storage. You can effectively get solar and backup power for almost free.", "I would agree, but I think you are also ignoring **risk** cost.  \n\n\nIf utility bills rise slowly, you're right, what if they rise faster than 7% on average and my solar would outperform the Dow?  The risk of this happening must be priced actuarially if you want to have a truely accurate forcast.

That\u2019s 4 years of free power, or ~25%. So if you immediately sold that house your 20k investment in solar likely increased house value by 25k+\n\nThat\u2019s a one year return of 5k or 25%. Much better than stock market\n\nBut maybe you\u2019re upgrading your house because you actually like it. Depending on how interest rates compare to the interest rate on your mortgage, a cash out refinance could be an option. Maybe the refinance process costs you $2k. So profit is only $3k. Still 1 year return of 15%. A good refinance isn\u2019t always possible, but if it is you can quickly access the increased home value of adding solar.\n\nI was also talking with a buddy after he was pitched a zero cost solar solution. This company provides financing for him to install solar, reducing his electricity bill by $150/mo. Then he makes a loan payment of $150/mo. So no difference in his budget, but after ~12 years he\u2019s paid off the loan and panels are still good for another 8 years under warranty. \n\nSo several ways to reduce opportunity cost of installing solar panels so that it isn\u2019t out performed by stock market.", "Spent \u00a35k on pannels, just calculated the first year electricity reduction and export saved me \u00a31k - so yes these will pay themselves off in about 4 years time.", "Solar panels cost a fraction of what they used to. Like many other upcoming technologies it was initially thousands upon thousands of dollars to get solared installed on your home But as companies started adapting it more and we started streamlining the process to actually creating solar cells and finding more efficient ways to do it we've been able to drop them to a fraction of what they used to cost. With the only real major hurdle into the market being the large battery system you will have to get installed\n\n and there are many alternatives for solar energy that are even cheaper and still highly efficient such as using solar reflector arrays instead of traditional solar panels using effectively half circle shaped domes that can rotate with the passing of the Sun and are effectively a metal sheet reflecting heat towards a central pipe making it hot enough to vaporize the water into steam and drive a turbine ((or a very similar system where there is basically a central heating tower surrounded by a bunch of basically mirrors that are all positioned to direct the light towards a spot on the top of that tower to ultimately achieve the same goal))\n\nThese could easily work on a home and there are already several large scale power plants that have been built with this exact system\n\nWe don't need crazy dangerous expensive to maintain systems like nuclear or tidal energy when we could easily use something as simple as a few reflective pieces of metal and some water-filled pipes to obtain more energy than we could possibly need", "While I'm not ever planning on buying solar myself (my home's roof is largely shaded by trees, it just doesn't make sense for me), I'd argue that solar panels CAN be a better investment than the S&amp;P 500 or similar depending on the timing of the market. Investing in solar will save you money every month on a pretty predictable pattern - so it's a lot more fair to compare investing in solar to buying bonds or CD's than investing in corporations. If you have the option today to put $20k in the market or $20k into a solar system, and the next month we go through a recession and the market drops 30% and takes 5 years to break-even, I'm sure the solar system would have been a better investment. Then the argument becomes whether the solar panels are a better investment than bonds if you're using it as a low-risk form of investing while still having a separate large portfolio in stocks.", "To start I am not the type of scenario you are asking about so I know I wont change your mind but I wanted to give another situation where its payback is immediate.\n\nI built an offgrid lake front house that runs on solar. I saved roughly 120k compared to a similar lot with grid power available. There is no possibility to get grid power to my property.\n\nMy offgrid system including panels, batteries, inverter charger and backup generator cost me a total of about 30k, it was self installed. \n\nThe way I figure it my system paid for itself 4 times over the day I turned it on and continues to save me more every month. I do have a propane bill for backup generator but that is significantly less then a normal electric bill in my area. And I will have to replace batteries eventually but I could replace them 10 times and still be cheaper then if I had bought a lot with grid power.", "I bought solar, $36,000 pre-rebate. 26.6k after taxes rebate (4ish years ago)x \n13.5kW system running on a 10kW inverter. Debated bigger inverter but saved up front cash by losing some to power clipping mid day. \n\n17.5 MWh generated on average annually, reported by my inverter and confirm with xcel bills.\n\nPower generation savings\nRoughly $3000 in saving/revenue against my power bill annually (Assuming $.17-$.19 kWh net metering at 100% buy back pricing) \n\nBonus savings \n$1200-1500 bonus payments from xcel for SolarRewards for first 6 years (~$9000)\n\nPayback: \n26k cost - 9k solar rewards= 17k remaining cost \n\n17k-3k = my system will payback in a little under 6 years. Took out a 1.99% loan for 10 years to buy it, tax rebate and rewards have all go to loan, otherwise I just pay the a little extra monthly. Should be paid off before break even pretty easily", "I think how you are phrasing your argument is poor. I would argue that solar easily pays for itself almost immediately but doesn't start making money until significantly later. A lot of solar companies act like it's going to generate money and that is not likely the case. \n\nMy solar was 18k loan with zero down roughly 3% interest. The monthly bill was roughly 125$ which was already lower than my electric bill. Selling the srec credits each year was roughly 750$. There is likely an increase in property value and potential savings in protection from replacement of the roof. There is also risk in terms of anything happened to the system the repairs and loss of generation.\n\nI think it's a mixed investment. But if the terms of the loan are good it can easily break even or make money. Also I am sure this varies from state/company/install.", "I don't know if opportunity cost is relevant to this discussion. It is a major house upgrade. I don't mean extention or refurb which the new owners may not like it is an upgrade which is unlikely to be removed. The solar panels therefore increase the value of the house. The panels will gain value with the house.\u00a0\n\n\nUsing s&amp;p500 isn't typical practice for opportunity cost. You obviously can use it but usually interest rates are used as they are much more reliable. You could lose all your money on the stock market it's very rare to lose money buying bonds. Bond rates are about 5%.\n\n\nUltimately, if you think house prices are rising at less than 5% then your argument starts to come into play but most places are seeing house prices increasing rapidly. I think there are better arguments against the napkin maths you used.", "I did the sums and where I live the payback period was very short even taking into account any expected ROI on investments, or even on the riskless return of paying down the mortgage. That is because it is sunny here and that will be the case for anywhere sunny in lower latitudes. Or indeed anywhere with high electricity costs from the grid.\u00a0\n\n\nSo I don't think your claim that it is unlikely to provide a reasonable return stacks up. It depends on so many other variables than just the opportunity cost of the capital.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you wanted to go even further, you could say that your analysis omits the benefit of electrifying tools once you have installed solar. Depending on use, you could save significantly on petrol if you change your car, garden tools, hot water, stoves, etc to electric equivalents.\u00a0", "The problem with this whole post is that Solar Panels can actually pay for themselves. But it's dependent on a myriad of conditions. Where you are located, how many solar panels you put on your roof, what your monthly use of electricity is, which company you get your panels from, etc. That's why there's a lot of variation as to how long it takes to get a full return on investment.\n\nWhile yes, I hear people say that 20 years is kind of the norm, I also know that it's possible to get a turn on investment in 10 years. Once you get past that, you start saving money, which adds to the accumulation of overall wealth, which then can subsequently be spent in other investments, like a 401k for instance.", "So on average markets returns about 10% which is about $166 per month on 20k invested. \n\nHowever these returns fluctuate a lot, between +20% and -10% year to year whereas solar investment is roughly 40% less income on average but far more stable, especially when insured as part of your home insurance or covered by warranty. \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 returns also assume that the market cap is infinite, and growth will never level off. And we know that isn't true, growth will definitely reach a plateau at some point, maybe in 20 years and maybe in 200 or 2000 years. \n\nSo yeah, riskier investments yield higher returns on average and safer investments yield consistent returns. Nothing new here.", "My father sells and installs PV panels in Brazil. I have here a proposal he made, back in December, for a system with 3,78 kW, which he estimated would generate 5595 kWh on the first year. He is an engineer and used engineering software for this estimate, considering real historical insolation and nebulosity data for the region. The total cost to the client would be R$ 12,810.00 (but this is was in the low end, because the guy is a friend).\n\nThe kWh costs R$ 1.02, so, a return of R$ 5706,90 per year, or 44%. Even factoring in the 0.6% panel efficiency degradation per year, you get your money back in less than 3 years, less than the manufacturer's warranty for the equipment.", "Solar started saving me money instantaneously. The monthly loan payment is less than the average monthly electric/gas bill. And the loan disappears in a couple more years. Then come tax time, we got those sweet tax credits. Once a year we get a check from the electric company for our excess production. I\u2019ve run the heat and AC with reckless abandon. Hot tub and other power-hungry electric toys lost all of the negative edge.\n\nI live where electricity is ridiculously expensive, so maybe that matters. It\u2019s also very sunny here. If you live somewhere cloudy with cheap electricity and shittier net metering arrangements, i\u2019m sure solar isn\u2019t as fantastic.", "Where I am there is two electricity price regimes. \n\nRegime 1 is the same unit price 24 hours a day.\n\nRegime 2 is a high day rate and a low night rate. \n\nOne of the main benefits of solar is that it makes the cheap night rate make sense. So it saves you money when its not generating power.\n\nThe second benefit of solar is that the benefit is cash in your pocket. You don't have to pay cgt on your gain.\n\nIf you are invested in stocks and gain 9% you have to sell and pay tax to access the gain. The real gain may be 6% after tax.\n\nGains from solar are probably a lot more predictable than stocks. Its more akin to a safe investment.", "You failed to account for two things:\n1. Is s&amp;p500 or whatever index you would invest into going to outpace the cost of electricity in your area?\n2. Whatever you gain by investing will be taxed, so will the index outpace the cost of energy by more than the tax rate?\n\nBoth depend on where you live. If you live in a place with high enough energy cost and high enough capital gain taxes, the opportunity cost is offset by the solar installation.\n\nI won't run the numbers but I think we can agree that it's not at all obvious that s&amp;p500 will grow faster than the energy bill by more than the taxation on investment gains.", "This is absolutely incorrect in many ways but not in all ways. If you do buy used panels which you can get in abundance then you can absolutely make your money back in no time. Especially if you value the ability to have power when the rest of your neighborhood loses it from a storm or what have you. It's also useful for putting power where you don't already have it like a garage or shed. To live your entire life on solar might be difficult and may not be as cost-effective as some claim but it has a lot of potential and you can always excuse it by saying you're helping the environment(arguably not).", "Just to chime in on a few things I haven\u2019t seen mentioned yet:\n\n1. Does this increase roof maintenance costs if the roof requires work? Do panels increase or decrease the life of a roof? \n\n2. Do they actually increase the value of a house or are real estate values driven more by the plot of land they sit on (or the bubble in which they\u2019re purchased)? I find it hard to guarantee I\u2019ll be in any one location for the life of the panels.\n\n3. The panels have a life and a decommissioning cost? 20 years and $1000 to tear down? Whatever this cost is, someone is bearing it.", "I would love to go solar, our hose faces the right way, and gets good sun in New Jersey.  \n\n\nBut I just can't trust the industry. \n\nEvery single person I've talked to has buyers regret, not from the Panels but from the sleezy contracts and salesmen. It always seems to be one scam after another, if there are ANY honest solar installers/brokers they are so lost in the pile of sleaze that you can't trust any of them. \n\nUntil the industry gets better regulation, I'll just keep insulating my windows and try to save money elsewhere.", "&gt;I\u2019m assuming normal family suburban homes.\n\nIn Australia or in Norway?", "$100 a month is clearly not a heavy electricity user. With two electric cars and heavy AC usage, plus a few beefy computers pulling a lot of power, my family uses quite a bit more than $100 a month... closer to $600 for us in the summer.\n\nPlus, I actually had negative opportunity cost, since I got 30% cash back from the government and the interest rate on my loan is less than the rate I get on my savings account. I got EXTRA cash in my pocket, earning more in interest at the bank, by getting solar.", "While I do not have solar on my home, I have considered it.\n\nYou mention that solar has brought your utility bill down from $100 to $0 per month.\n\nI think you should consider that your utility cost is lower than average. In my home here in Texas, for around 1,800 square feet, my house uses between $170 to $350 per month in electricity depending on weather.\n\nWould not a solar system alleviating a person $300 per month pay for itself in 1/3 the time you mentioned?", "In some US states, you not only get a return from using the energy you produce, you also get [SRECs](https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org/learn-the-issues/solar-incentives/solar-renewable-energy-credits-srecs/#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20SREC?,(RPS)%20in%20each%20state.), \n I sell my SRECs for a little over $300 each and my system produces about 10 SRECs a year, so that 3K a year plus I don't pay an electricity bill any more and I got like an 6K tax credit.

The mutual intelligibility of the two differs vastly based upon the context of communication I\u2019m having. A lot of communication lies in cultural awareness and the ability to mold language to the moment appropriately. \n\nAn anecdote from Siberia: I lived there awhile and met several folks trying to learn English or teach it. Given the geographic position of the region, they taught with a hybrid of various Anglo dialects. The US-British-Aussie dialect ended up being much clearer for me as a speaker of American English than pure British Standard English. By teaching English from the various perspectives of the Anglo world, the students had a very clear (but unspecialized, dialectically) form of English. My experience with Anglo fusion here makes me question your take on dialects. \n\nIs a dialect really able to become the clearest of them all? My experience shows a fusion is the clearest way to communicate. Dialectic specialization is great given a person\u2019s desire to live/work in a specific area. If the desire is to learn a versatile English, devoting oneself to one dialect may hinder growth and overall understanding of the language. Learning the language enough to move between dialects is a huge sign of mastery, yet a standard point should come before multi-dialectic mastery can be achieved. \n\nPerhaps because there are so many dialects of English, only a hybrid stands the chance of being the most intelligible. The lack of standard in hybrid English is its strength in being most widely understood. \n\nIf a Siberian student of English went up against a south Londoner and a Pittsburgher, I\u2019d imagine they\u2019d understand more than the pittsburgher or s Londoner would alone.", "This post kind of doesn\u2019t argue what the title says.

There definitely has been a reach that British English has had historically- but in 2024? Hollywood and American cultural media has dominated the last century in a way that British media just\u2026 hasn\u2019t? \n\nIf there\u2019s a standard English nowadays, it\u2019s far more likely to be the American one that\u2019s evoked in people\u2019s minds.", "It\u2019s kind of like arguing vanilla is the best ice cream.", "Hi OP:\n\nYou make some interesting arguments ngl, but let me make an ***unconventional one*** (since your update already clarified that American English bit)\n\nyou are looking at a strictly utilitarian viewpoint; a language is only good if it provides a service. Let me ask you something that hopefully isn't too personal: did you grow up working-class OP? If so, it doesn't surprise me! I'm a linguistic nerd, but I also grew up working class and ended up surrounded by a bunch of people who aren't, and I think I get what you're saying and where you're coming from. My argument isn't going to be based on utility or linguistic merit; simply **on taste.** I'm just going to use 3 examples OP, it might be a long post but I promise it's worth it. The three examples are going to be food, music, and art.\n\nSome context:\n\nThere's this dude named Pierre Bourdieu, and his work is kind of a hard concept to grasp. Basically, he argues that how we perceive ANYTHING is based on cultural factors, such as upbringing, education, and socioeconomic factors. I'll use myself as an example: I grew up eating a lot of spicy foods. Now, I eat a lot of spicy foods as an adult while some of my friends (who never touched the stuff growing up) still don't touch it as adults. Easy to follow along yeah? Ok, now let's do music.\n\nSay you grew up listening to rap; you can have phenomenally talented rappers who incorporate/master many aspects of music. Who is someone to say it's a trash genre compared to Mozart? This is an example of taste being a barrier to perception. There's merit in both, but one might just not see any of the merit in the other. I know people who call classical boring, I know people who call rap crap. They're both sheltered in their own way, I'm not going to get into the complexities of music, but just keep their adamancy in mind.\n\nThis \"taste barrier\" can also be seen in food, where Mexican food is looked down upon and things like french/italian cuisine is put on a pedastol. Both have merit and just because one is more popular and valued to different people doesn't make it better than the other; chef Anthony Bourdain (RIP GOAT) even recognized this. On a similar note; 2PAC is looked down upon while Mozart is also on that pedestal for similar reasons.\n\nThe last example I'm giving is about art. look at home decor: The rich get wild, crazy stuff in their place that serves no purpose, and it's \"artistic,\" while when the working class does it, it's \"tacky\" or just a knack. Fashion is also different. Think of leather jackets and cardigans; I learned that the working class values utility more than anything.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say OP is that  really more than popularity that makes a language **better**. POP is the most popular music in the world, but that **doesn't make it the best type of music** in the world. Hopefully you get what I'm trying to say here bud.\n\nBut if you think that one language can be better than most; then you also have to agree things like French food being the best in the world and pop music being the best in the world simply because there's a good chance most people won't hate it...which is a hot take imo but if that's your take so be it. But I will say if that still is your stance, you're missing out.  What makes all that stuff great is that you can enjoy a lot of it. You don't need to limit yourself to just one. Yeah, it's definitely fun to know more than one language; you get a whole new world open to you. The same is said about different dialects; hell, look at Obama. He was able to unite the country speaking two tongues\n\nthank you for reading", "Better and universally understandable are not the same thing. Now tbf, \"better\" doesnt really mean anything, it needs to be defined more specifically. But imo your making a mistake by adding a value judgment by saying \"better\" when you mean universally understandable.\n\nI sure that some accents are more universally understood than others, and that feels like a practical/objective question. You could do surveys and stuff and figure it out. But the \"better\" accent, imo, is the one that best facilitates communication, and that varies with each situation and who is involved in the conversation.", "I'm a native Spanish speaker and I can assure you that American English is preferred over British English when it comes to learning the language, at least here (Chile). It's more simplistic, widely used and British accent is considered way harder to understand. \n\nIf British English is preferred on your place, then calling the dialect better is pointless because it's a matter of perspective and which dialect is easier becomes subjective, probably tied to your native language.", "&gt;British English is usually sufficient to communicate with speakers of other English dialects.\n\nWhich British English?", "Most Americans watching British TV shows have to do so with subtitles, at least until they get used to the accents.  My understanding is that a show like Friends or Seinfeld doesn't ever get shown with subtitles on British TV.  So that small thing should invalidate your view.", "Since American English is more simple than British English, I'd argue that its better applicable internationally. So far only European countries prefer the British language mostly because they are close to UK. Any other region other than Oceania countries and former colonies usually teach American dialect.", "Just no, the other dialects are better for the people who speak that particular dialect. That's why they speak that dialect, they aren't \"torturing\" themselves. They speak what is more useful and better for them", "If you \\*had\\* to measure which dialects were better or worse than others, I think whether or not foreigners can understand it is not a good metric.\n\nI'm thinking, in particular, of the local dialects of Singapore and Malaysia. Singlish and Manglish both reflect the cultural diversity of the countries they occupy; they're peppered with words from Malay, Tamil, and various Chinese dialects. That makes them almost completely incomprehensible to outsiders. It also makes them alive, beautiful, and interesting, a reflection of the people.\n\nIn Singapore's case, most can codeswitch, so if you don't care to engage in learning the slang, you can just speak in plain boring English and people will reciprocate. But there's heavy foreign influence pressing on the country from all sides, and a constant inflow of expats. Having a sort of 'secret' language that you don't really understand unless you make an effort to engage with local culture helps maintain a national identity. And I think your dialect maintaining such an important social role makes it better than one any foreigner can understand.\n\nThe percentage of immigrants in Malaysia is a lot lower, but with the higher racial and religious tensions there, I think the same principle applies. The country as a whole tends to be very divided along racial lines; it's quite common that people don't have a single friend of a different ethnicity, work only with people of the same ethnicity, etc etc. In the same vein, having a sort of 'secret language' that only locals understand helps to maintain a national identity and a sense of kinship for countrymen of different ethnicities and religions.", "I\u2019m not a speaker of British English, but I suspect Standard British English isn\u2019t a dialect that is really spoken.

While British Standard English may be widely understood, linguistic diversity reflects cultural heritage and regional identity. Each dialect offers unique insights into local customs, history, and values, enriching global communication. Moreover, prioritizing one dialect as superior perpetuates linguistic inequality and marginalizes speakers of other varieties. Understanding and appreciating linguistic diversity fosters empathy, inclusivity, and cultural exchange.

Why not? Portugal famously decriminalized all drugs years before this shift in American policy. Did Portugal also have a ln urban crack epidemic that they started?

So it only makes sense that the sun adds up to a different result.\n\n\n&gt;where was this sympathy for crack users in the 80s and 90s\n\n\nThat's part of what changed. Society and eventually some elements of government started looking at it through a lens of \"how can we actually fix or alleviate this expensive, pervasive problem\" instead of \"how can we punish undesirable people\" because it wasn't working for literally anybody except the prison industry.\n\n\n&gt;If a government can go from locking people up for crack to enabling drug users then they definitely put crack in the hood\n\n\nAgain, this is not evidence or anything really.

Even if everything you say is true it isn't evidence the government _started_ the crack epidemic in the 80s.\n\nBut putting that aside, the evolution in policy you are seeing is an evolution of our understanding of drug use, its impact on society, and how to effectively lower harm.  \n\nIn the 80's/90's we were scared of rising crime rates associated with drug use and we decided that severe criminalization and law enforcement was the way to solve that problem.  People honestly thought cities would end up like they were depicted in _RoboCop_ - crime-ridden hellscapes where drug kingpins were more powerful than politicians.\n\nIn the decades that followed, we saw those policies were less effective than we had hoped.  Many feel that the \"war on drugs\" has been an abject failure, doing little to curb drug use and being responsible for the changing role of police in our society, including their militarization.  This says nothing about the impact those laws have had on many communities.\n\nSo folks are trying a different tactic.  Rather than treating drug use as a crime, they are treating it as an illness.  Safe injection sites, readily accessible OD mediation, testing strips, etc. are all policies to help mitigate the damage that drugs can do to the user.  We've accepted that folks who are doing drugs _are going to keep doing drugs_ so we are trying to make it as safe as possible while (hopefully) giving them access to resource to get clean.\n\nYou can disagree with this change in policy, and I'll be the first to say we don't know yet if this change will be effective.  However, that change in approach is not evidence that the government is behind or responsible for drug usage.", "&gt;You can\u2019t tell me a government that is all of a sudden so laissez-faire with drugs didn\u2019t start the crack epidemic.\n\nClassic reddit \"I have absolutely no proof but I have iron clad opinions and you can't change them\"", "How are these two things at all related?

Why is crack included in the current sympathy?  \n\nI would totally agree with the idea that drug laws and enforcement are heavily skewed based on racial or economic differences.  But making and enforcing laws in a way that keeps a group down seems far simpler than creating a specific drug problem and then creating laws to target it.  If you are already crafting targeted laws, why not pick a target that\u2019s already there?\n\nAn alternative explanation is that we realized our drug laws are a pretty inneffective deterrent and that since we haven\u2019t found a good way to stop drug use we should instead try to lessen the harm it causes through overdose and disease.", "I think it's more of a matter of\u00a0after 40 years of the same methods it's stamp it out its time to accept that despite the best efforts its here to stay and now do damage control and minimize the damage.

Same with drugs, test kits stop the overdose meaning some poor EMT or firefighter isn't lugging a dead body out of a house, overdose kits means that kids don't have to watch a parent die waiting for emergency services, and clean needle/needle exchange means innocent bystanders are at less risk of picking something like HIV while living their lives.

The epidemic was fueled by a combination of factors including socioeconomic disparities, systemic racism, and the illegal drug trade. While government negligence, such as the Iran-Contra affair, contributed to the spread of crack cocaine, it's overly simplistic to place sole blame on the government. Individuals, communities, and various institutions all played roles in the epidemic's proliferation. Recognizing this complexity allows for a more nuanced understanding of the issue and facilitates more effective strategies for prevention and intervention.

This is one of the reasons I was ultimately able to leave my abusive ex. It took a long time, but I could never shake the feeling that my marriage was not how marriage is supposed to be. Because I looked at my late grandfathers,  my dad, my brother, my brother in law, my uncle, many family friends and I didn't see those men treating women the way my (ex) husband was treating me. \n\nI do think getting to know men outside of your family and cultural circles may help, but it's ok if you're not ready for that. It might be helpful first to work on connecting with  women who have a positive view of men, which will give you second-hand exposure to men without you having to feel like you're putting yourself in danger. \n\nAlso, if you have any way to access mental health treatment, please pursue this. You have been hurt very deeply, in numerous ways. Your fears and anger after these things are completely understandable and normal, but you want to move forward and not let this permanently keep you from being able to live a man. Sometimes professional help is needed with things like this. \n\nOne of the reasons I am in a relationship now even after having been abused by my ex is that my partner is a good man, and also a patient and understanding man. I was very guarded and fearful when we first started talking. He was kind and patient. Never pressured, never tried to take advantage. He knew some of my past hurts, and told me to set a pace in our developing relationship was comfortable for me. And then he scrupulously respected that pace and my boundaries. In several years together now he has never said an unkind word to me. Not one. He has *never* insulted me or demeaned me. Never hit me, never threatened me.  He has never demanded sex, nor went ahead with sex without my consent. If he has even the slightest sense that I'm not really into it, he will back off and find nonsexual ways to connect with me. He loves who I am as a person and doesn't think less of me because I am a woman. He sees us as equals, and follows through with that in his behavior. \n\nIt is a tragedy that you have been surrounded your entire life by men with such diseased character. I hope you've found help in the comments hear and I hope you'll continue to pursue healing. I hope that in the process of healing you will encounter and take note of men who are good and kind and respectful. And I hope you'll find a man worthy of your love, and who shows you what it means to truly be loved.", "First of all, I'm sorry that happened to you. No one deserves to experience that.\n\nSecondly, I totally understand your point. Studying criminal justice, I understand the statistics. If you're going to be the victim of a violent crime, it's almost guaranteed to be a man.\n\nHowever I hope to change your view from a different angle. I'm a gay dude, I'm obsessed with men. I love the male body, the way guys think and how they act. I can appreciate a firm talking woman but the sound of a man's voice is just beautiful, for me.\n\nI have read and seen enough to understand why you feel that way. I haven't experienced sexual violence and I hope I never do. However I also see a different side of men on social media. I see adorable couples snuggling and spending time together. I see gym bros hyping each other up and encouraging others. I see the glowing energy that radiates from Pride events.\n\nMen are capable of love, respect, gentleness, and grace. I truly hope you get to enjoy that one day.", "I've always kind of wondered about the impact of these kind of comments on women who have been abused, I am so sorry that you have to read this kind of stuff after what you've been through. \n\nI know so many good men.

Both genders can be depraved , both genders can be vulnerable, we are all human after all. Perhaps this will help shift the paradigm of one particular gender doing bad to another\n\nThat said, therapy is something to consider if you are able to/willing, they are qualified compared to strangers on the internet , or I\u2019m not sure if your country has any place where you can get some counseling, or some ngo or sth where people are experienced to help with these sort of issues", "Some men are depraved.

I\u2019m sorry for that, but still I would say the vast majority of men are not at all how you describe.  Most people overall have some sense of decency,  and would be horrified at any of these actions.

You had mentioned that you see lots of posts about men wanting to murder women. In what form of social media is that?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I know men do say stuff like that on the Internet. And I've seen men say some nasty stuff on social media. But in my experience, between instagram, Facebook, etc, even the shitter comment sections aren't full of men threatening to murder women. \n\nIt's especially surprising considering that you avoid social media, and in your brief exposure it seems that this is common. \n\nAre these murder posts something you actually see in the wild on social media? Or are they posts/comments that are reposted on other pages?  Obviously not that it is bad for these things to be reposted to raise awareness. It's important. However your specific view in question is that \"all men are depraved\". And seeing that kind of content posted to spread awareness over and over may start to make it seem like all men are like that- when really it's the worst 1 percent, and the content spreads like wildfire.\n\nI don't mean to deny the reality of the violent and terrible things many men say and do. It's very real and important to talk about. But if people shared as many posts about the normal, peaceful, uneventful men as they did about the violent ones, then you might not feel the same about all men being depraved", "As a man, I can say the less sex I am having, the more I think about it / it clouds my mind, makes me ruder, etc. I think a most men are similar.

That sentence alone probably describes the majority of adult age men. But that group is made up of fathers (good and bad), sons (good and bad), grandpas (good and bad), etc. Some may let their near obsession with sex cause them to do bad or even terrible things, some (most) are able to find a way to deal with their urges in a healthy way that allow them to be good people.", "&gt;My entire life, I have never known a single woman who hasn't been hurt by a man. All of my female family members have been raped.\n\nRAINN reports that 1 in 6 American woman have been the victim of SA. Even if we say that only 1 out of 4 women victims report it, that still leaves ~30ish% of women who have likely never been a victim of it. Surely you know *one* of these women. \n\nPutting that aside, even if we say 100% of women are SA victims, does that automatically mean 100% of men are perpetrators? No, of course not. \n\n&gt;I usually try to stay away from social media, but whenever I expose myself to it, there's tons of men complaining about women. Tons of men making negative comments about women. Too many men threatening to rape and murder women.\n\nHonestly I see the exact opposite. I see more posts that are along the lines of your post here. How all men are shitty. I'm not saying that the posts you see don't exist, I know they do. But social media is also what you make it; who you follow, what you engage with. Perhaps it's time for a complete clean out and refresh the type of people you follow. \n\n&gt;I see men complaining about how their wives have headaches or stomachaches, how they nag. That a perfect woman is nothing more than a lone pair of legs. I see men replacing their girlfriends for newer, more attractive ones. Like replacing an appliance with a new model. I see men demanding sex from women. It's always about sex. It's always sex. I always see that the most. A type of \"entitlement\" to sex.\n\nAgain, I feel this is another example of who you surround yourself with. There are plenty of long term marriages where none of this has occurred. Men who support their partners. \n\n&gt;I've been treating all men as though they are out to hurt me, that their ultimate goal is to get a good lay and throw me out when better comes around. That who I am as a person doesn't matter. I treat all of them as though they are sick, disgusting deviants.\n\nThis is honestly probably a good defensive mechanism, because there definitely are plenty of men out there like the ones you're describing. But it seems you have taken it to an extreme. You have let it affect your own self-worth, and even jaded your view about your own dad. Has he ever given you any reason to believe these things about him?\n\n&gt;I am desperate to lose this view. I want to see the good in them. I want to believe there's men out there that care about me, that want to listen to what I have to say, and are genuinely interested in me as a person. I don't want to be scared or intimidated by them. I don't want to think my own father fantasizes about raping me. I want a man to think of protecting me after hearing what happened to me instead of stating my loss in value.\n\nThere are guys like this. They exist. I don't really know how to change your view besides saying that you'll meet one some day. But I think you have gotten yourself to a point where a CMV on Reddit is never going to reverse your thinking on this. I honestly believe this is something that you should probably work on with a therapist, not anonymous strangers on Reddit.\n\nEdit: I see in a comment you say you are in South Africa, so that negates the SA data I cited in the first point, and maybe kinda undoes my whole post. I can't speak for life and men there, but I can say that not 100% of men around the world are this way.", "All means every single one.   There are no shortage of depraved people both men and women, but it's a short term strategy, what can I extract from you for my own benefit at your expense.  It's not ever going to be the most successful strategy.  Basically it's just selfishness.  It's ugly, it's dark and it hurts people.  And it can manifest in many different forms.\n\nThere is another way.\n\n\"True success is being successful in a way that makes others around you also successful.\" (love him or hate him this is something I heard Jordan Peterson say and it's very insightful),  That's not depravity, probably the opposite of it.

However I would like to add that the objectification of women is not limited to porn in our society because women are constantly sexualized in advertisements, hooters, etc.. Which is an explanation that the objectification of women is largely a systemic issue that originates from the profit incentive that leads to things like dating(tinder) or sex(porn) to be* commodified.\n\nTo answer the question of how you can trust certain men despite the systemic objectification of women; let\u2019s consider in a similar manner not all white Americans are/where racist despite the systemic racism against African Americans and other minorities despite the past and present example systemic racism.\n\nIdk how to end this thought but I hope the comparison made enough sense, ALSO if you\u2019re interested there are plenty of Marxist feminist authors that might have written about topics you might be interested in :)", "First, I would like to say I am sorry for you, you shouldn't have had those experiences and no one ever should, I don't want to invalidate your experience as a victim of abuse but what you and those you care about have experienced does not represent the majority of men. \n\nWhat isn't said much is that \\~63% of all crime is done by only 1% of the population [\\[source\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24173408/#:~:text=violent%20crime%20convictions-,The%201%25%20of%20the%20population%20accountable%20for%2063%25%20of%20all,%2D013%2D0783%2Dy) and yes while this is still a majority of men this is still an extreme minority, it doesn't include unreported cases from male victims, and it also doesn't take into account the gender disparity of court sentencing where overall men are treated harsher for doing the same crime [\\[source\\]](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/files/209890205/Gender_gap.pdf). \n\nAs for social media, it is Anonymous, everyone is spewing vitriol, not just men. I am not trying to say it is okay but that if we have every single group spewing hatred everywhere of course you're going to see men targeting women, but highlighting that in particular when there are just as many women doing the same towards men is harmful. \n\nI don't know why I am telling you this, but you're privileged to be able to hold this view, I don't want to make this about me but when I was a child I was physically abused by someone I called a friend, as a young teenager a girl pretended to date me for over a month as a \"prank\" to humiliate me in front of her friends. The day after I turned 16 I was sexually harassed and groped by a drunk woman in her 40s at a Christmas party. None of these women/girls faced ANY repercussions and no matter what I experience, I cannot hold all women accountable for these people. \n\nNot only would I be called misogynistic, but I wouldn't be able to move past it. I am not telling you to trust men 100% that isn't realistic or fair but you at least can't treat all men like they're guilty of something they haven't shown any proof of doing.

A lot of men are depraved, and part of that is likely because so many are addicted to porn. You also have to realize that it's a lot harder for men to get sexual intimacy than women, especially in the modern era. So you have a lot of socially inept, sexually starved dudes out there who are probably lashing out.\n\nAnother part of it, and a lot of people will deny this and disagree with me vehemently, is that there are some not-so-flattering things lying in the subconscious of the vast majority of men AND women. And because of our biological differences, men and women have opposing strategies when it comes to sex, so we often get very angry at the opposite sex because of this conflict. For example, men have a desire for quantity, and women have a desire for quality because men can impregnate many women in a short period of time, and women can only be impregnated once a year. Furthermore, women become extremely vulnerable during and after pregnancy, so back in the caveman days, if they didn't have a high-quality man to look out for them, it meant death for both them and their children. So women hate men for wanting to screw everything that moves, and men complain about women being \"gold-diggers\" or not giving guys a chance because they're short, skinny, etc. Of course, there are exceptions; I'm just talking about statistical likelihood. I also think a lot of women have been traumatized and maybe just inherently like certain darker traits in men, which leads to more bad experiences with men.\n\nI'm really sorry for what happened to you, and you certainly shouldn't be viewed as worth less because of that horrific event. However, as far as your OTHER negative experiences with guys, I do wonder if it might be that you're surrounding yourself with the wrong types of guys. There are a lot of relatively good guys out there, but sometimes they're not as exciting, so some girls don't even notice their existence. If you're not noticing them, then it's likely that you're either in a very bad area or you might have trauma that causes you to seek out guys with certain negative traits (trauma can be addictive).", "Lets be real you are damaged, and even if the guy you are talking to is not bad, you will bring that side of him out, and most likely he will not even do or say a bad thing and only appropriately react to your.

It\u2019s a rude awakening in the beginning when you realize how much men hate women. However, after the initial shock/grieving period, I think it\u2019s possible to start seeing this realization as empowering. Your understanding of male depravity will allow you to protect yourself as best you can and to surround yourself with wonderful women that bring you great joy and comfort. You\u2019ll come to realize that men need women a lot more than women need men: single women are consistently happier, healthier, and live longer than married women (the reverse is true for men). Don\u2019t hesitate to DM me if you\u2019d like to talk more \ud83d\udc95\n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to clarify why I think that you are right. Studies have shown that 1/3 of male college students would rape if they knew they could get away with it. 1/6 Australian men have fantasized about having sexual contact with minors, 1/10 Australian men have admitted to acting on those feelings. A majority of men watch/masturbate to porn that objectifies and degrades women (90% of porn contains some form of violence against women).", "I\u2019m going to assume you understand that the reason a lot of men are like this is because of socialization.

Society is already of the opinion that hypermasculininity and hyperfemininity are innate (most of misogyny stems from this idea), and the best way to counter that is to spread the narrative that masculine/feminine roles are more fluid than we think. Saying \u201call women are this, are men are that\u201d just makes it worse.\n\nThis is also very gender essentialist, which doesn\u2019t take into account a lot of nuance. What about gay/bi men? What about masculine lesbians? Tr@ns men? Tr@ns women? What about men who were raised by women, or raised in more progressive countries?\n\nIt\u2019s good to understand that there\u2019s a lot of misogyny and bad men in the world and take precautions to protect yourself from them both physically and mentally, but it\u2019s unhealthy for everyone if you start to think in absolutes.", "Not trying to change your view,  but change your circle of friends and people who surround you.

I think it\u2019s worth exploring the facts together and then I can show you my interpretation. \n\nStudies show men are more prone to extreme behavior than women. That means there are more extremely altruistic men (there are more altruistic women altogether, I\u2019m just talking about extremes) and also more extremely sadistic men. There are more male criminals, but men are also more likely to step up and stop a criminal (or fight a righteous war like ww2 or Ukraine vs Russia).\n\nMen, as a population, are more dangerous than women because of this extremity and their physicality. \n\nHowever they are also more likely to become obsessed with a noble cause devote/sacrifice their life for humanity as suggested by studies of differences in male and women\u2019s priorities. \n\nThe average male brain is very different from the average female brain, but it doesn\u2019t mean we are all depraved. \n\nWe aren\u2019t as good at emotional support, but studies show we are better at emotionally detached problem solving. We use only the logical part of our brains when problem solving while women use both the emotional and logical domains. This tends to make us less empathetic but also less emotionally reactive which is a very useful trait at times. \n\nThis is all to say, men and women are different, correct. Men represent more of the criminal(depraved) population, correct, but men also make many valuable and altruistic contributions to society. \n\nMen as a population are probably more depraved than the female population. But the variation in the male population is much greater than the variation in the female population also. There are very genuinely good men (possibly more than women!) and there are very genuinely evil men (probably more than women.).\n\nSo no, not ALL men are depraved. The most important thing to understand is that the characteristics of a population are not a good guide to predicting the characteristics of an individual in that population if their is a large variance in traits (and studies show there\u2019s very large variance in the male population).", "I'm truly sorry you're feeling this way; it sounds incredibly tough, and it takes a lot of courage to open up about these feelings.

It's exhausting and lonely, isn't it? While I can't claim to understand exactly what you're going through, I recognize that longing for a sense of safety and genuine connection.\n\nIt sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden, expecting the worst based on past experiences. It's understandable but also so isolating. Not all men will see or treat you the way you fear, though it might seem that way based on what you've been through. There are individuals out there capable of offering the understanding, respect, and protection you seek. It might help to start small, finding safe spaces or communities where positive, respectful interactions with men are encouraged and fostered. It could offer a new perspective and perhaps start to mend the trust that's been so deeply shaken. It's okay to set boundaries and take things at your own pace.

But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free.\u201d (9:5). In plain English, this means that \u201cidolaters\u201d are to be killed, unless they convert to Islam and begin following Islamic laws such as paying alms (\u201cthe poor-due.\u201d)\n\n\nThis is specifically about polytheist religions - originally Arab pagans, but then there were extensive fatwas against Tengrism which shape modern doctrine most extensively.

While not being directly false, it is implying that this would apply to Christians, when it specifically does not. Of major religions it really only applies to Hindus and Buddhists. \n\n&gt; However, Muslims must fight Jews and Christians as well, although the Qur\u2019an recognizes that as \u201cPeople of the Book\u201d they have received genuine revelations from Allah: \u201cFight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya [the special tax on non-Muslims] with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued\u201d (9:29).\n\n\"this outgroup must pay taxes to be under our protection\" isnt really abnormal in any society in all of history.\n\n&gt; Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328), a Hanbali jurist who is a favorite of bin Laden and other modern-day jihadists, explained that the aim of jihad was \u201cthat the religion is God\u2019s entirely and God\u2019s word is uppermost, therefore according to all Muslims, those who stand in the way of this aim must be fought.\u201d\n\nNote the year, and that man lived from 1263 to  1328.

The idea is that resources need to be managed as efficiently as possible, maximizing the value returned by their usage.

That means investing in its production capacity, creating efficiencies, improving its brand recognition and trust among other things. \n\nBoeing clearly did the opposite of that by eroding future profitability. If they had said that they were compromising quality to maximize profits at their annual shareholder meetings, their CEO would have been kicked out of the company in the most literal sense of the word possible.

Your only risk of jailtime is repeatedly flipping the bird to the judge but that's under Contempt of Court, not Copyright.\n\nTo be clear, there *are* cases where it's a crime but most of those wouldn't really involve the internet enough that someone would specifically refer to it as \"internet piracy\", only as \"piracy\". A good example of this would be the wholesale bulk duplication of CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, and Betamax tapes, and then selling them at the swap meet.\n\nThe $250k fine and 6 months of jailtime isn't because your nerdy cousin downloaded Avengers off of BitTorrent. But the site hosting that torrent and thousands of others, and also running trackers which are seeding the torrents? That would cross the threshold into criminal piracy.

I have a couple questions.\n\nIf the law is that you can't abolish any laws? And I try to abolish this law. Am I a criminal?\n\nAre we permanently stuck in the stone ages?", "First, let's look at the root of this under US law. All creative works belong to all of the people by default. There is no natural property right, so comparing it to any material theft just doesn't work. As Jefferson said, \n\n&gt;He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.\n\nHowever, the founders realized some incentive to create works would be good in order to promote the creation of more works. Thus in the Constitution they granted the allowance for a limited monopoly on creative works in return for them being published. This is copyright -- the granted right to copy, but with any exceptions the government deems fit. This copyright was meant to expire after a short time, as in an author needs to keep creating works in order to keep up his income (thus the incentive to create). For this purpose, copyright was originally 14 years plus a 14 year extension. \n\nViolations of this were copyright infringement, a civil matter. It was only in 1897 that the first criminal copyright provision was added, and then only for willful performance for profit motive. We didn't get the modern criminal provisions until 1992. And of course during this time copyright has been extended to absurd lengths. Now it's very rare for anything to go into the public domain, opposite of what was intended. \n\nSo:\n\n&gt;This is a crime because a person takes something from someone without permission. \n\nNo, this is only a crime because the government granted a monopoly, and much later decided to make infringement on that monopoly a crime. It isn't a crime in a natural property rights sense.", "data piracy is, in its essence, a kind of transmission of government protected/restricted ideas where the creator of the idea has paid the government to use force/violence to ensure no one else can use/reproduce their idea without paying a fee for its use and or being authorized by the originator. this could be as simple as repeating a phrase, or as complicated as implementing the ideas produced in a technical manual. it could be as benign as humming a tune heard on the radio to reproducing a time saving mechanism for use in your business. to use government violence (punishment excused/promoted by law) is the real injustice. the concept of owning an idea is itself illogical, especially as every idea uses others ideas techniques, processes and mechanisms produced by millions of other people. the belief that you (the supposed originator of the idea) are the offended party as you harm others that use or distribute the idea is pretty disgusting and frankly anti-progress.\n\ngovernment has one legitimate function, the protection of its people from other people. this doesn't include the pseudo-ownership of ideas. government gets this power via the collective right to defend one's self. we often outsource the right of self-defense to a defensive organization we call the government. when the power gained by government from its people for their defense is then turned in on its people as an offensive force, in a profit making scheme, the government has become evil, as have the people and corporations who corrupted the government to their bidding.\n\nnow, if you don't believe government should be limited to its fundamental purpose, or that the fundamental purpose of government is some other thing, you will need to show how that other fundamental purpose justifies the use of violence on its people to stop people from using data/ideas/reproductions to ensure others profit from those ideas. if you cannot, then, as far as i can tell, you have no logic to back your argument.\n\nfurthermore, a lack of potential profit under one reality as opposed to another imagined reality isn't the same as harm or victimhood. to be harmed or be a victim requires real (not imagined) damage (broken bones, unauthorized drained bank account, destruction of property for example) or artificial constraint (imprisonment for example). at best you could say that the originator is disadvantaged by the lack of profit, in which case i am also a disadvantaged as is everyone else who isn't the wealthiest person ever.", "&gt;But justifying a crime does not change the fact that it is a crime.\n\nOk so what makes a crime a crime? There's no strict definition of what is a crime and what isn't. It really depends on consensus both social and political.

Your thoughts on this matter don't consider that there is another party, who participates in the act of piracy - a person who illicitly distributes a digital ware.\n\nI still believe that a person, who cracks and/or distributes cracked software or leaks movies before they finished rolling in theaters are commiting serious offence because there is a clear victim - the company that owns the rights to the software or the movie.\n\nNow the act of downloading a software or a movie or a song is not a guilty act because it isn't a scarce good and has already been distributed.\n\nTo borrow from your example: If some supervillain illicitly obtains means to produce a PS5 or some other good and starts to sell it a lot cheaper than the original or even starts to give it away for free, the buyer/receiver won't be at fault for getting that good. \n\nThe guilty party here, clearly, is the villain, who commits the guilty act.

Why is it not ok to pirate this kind of content?\n\n2, a game is available, but the publisher didn't localize the prices, making it cost what would be a hundred something USD in my country. Whereas western countries are only paying like 40 bucks. Why is piracy not ok in this scenario?\n\n3, I have owned a piece of software for several years. It's a service I paid for once, and agreed to their terms and have been enjoying this software for free. But now the company has changed their terms and or pricing model.

Say I have a game or movie that I purchased. Not rented or subscribed to any streaming service. I paid for this product, but it does require constant access to a service in order to access it. As a consumer, I have the right to make copies of content for personal use. If I paid for something upfront, I own it, and I should be allowed to download or rip it so that I can keep owning it even after the service inevitably shuts down.

Downloading it for one's personal continued use is in essence no different than recording it with an old-school VCR or DVR, just without needing an extra device.\n* You need a version that is more accessible than the original version because you have a disability, e.g. so your screen reader can use text-to-speech to read the e-book to you, or turn it into touchable characters on a braille display.\n\nThese all technically happen \"without permission\" from the rights owner, yet they are perfectly moral.", "Am I physically (or even digitally) taking something from another person by pirating a movie?

Piracy often arises from factors like accessibility, affordability, and convenience rather than malicious intent. Many individuals resort to piracy due to barriers to legitimate access, such as high prices or regional restrictions. Punitive measures alone may not address the root causes of piracy or effectively deter offenders. Instead, efforts should focus on improving legal avenues for accessing content, educating the public about the importance of supporting creators, and implementing innovative solutions like streaming services and digital distribution platforms.

I believe a person\u2019s character is defined by their thoughts, urges, and actions, which in turn is just a product of two things: brain chemistry and external stimuli. Upon receiving an external stimulus (which could be outwardly physical like the five senses or mental like a thought or emotion), the brain produces an output, like a thought, urge, or action, and then rewires itself based on the perceived reward (how good/bad something feels, also based on neurochemistry). As a person grows, this brain chemistry and input-output relationship becomes progressively built upon and defines what a person will do, think, or feel at any given moment. The state a person ends up in is thus defined by their starting brain chemistry, the method of rewiring, (both genetic/nature) and the environment they are in (circumstantial/nurture). This is just my understanding from my limited knowledge of how the brain learns, with some concepts from reinforcement learning thrown in\u2014very open to believing this could be wrong. But in this framework there is only the illusion of control and not control itself.\n\nFor example, imagine you had infinite computing power and some incredible simulation tools that could create a computational learning agent that would interact with a dynamic world around it. You initialize like a thousand of these agents by putting them in different environments with different starting variables, and let them loose and observe (to be fair this is almost already a reality!) The programmers/observers would likely say that any behavior is not under any moral guidelines, and understand that an agent\u2019s output and action are just a product of the code/math, randomness, and the environment. To me, our DNA operates extremely similarly, with a similar conclusion to be drawn about our behavior. If a person commits first degree murder or another heinous crime, they had no control over whether they would have the thoughts to commit the crime, or whether they lacked the neural guardrails to prevent them from doing it. Less drastically, many don\u2019t view addiction as a moral failure, because it\u2019s just brain chemistry\u2014some are inevitably more susceptible than others. Likewise if someone is \u201cmorally good\u201d it can be argued that they were just lucky that the product of their brain chemistry and environment aligned with societal values.\n\nThings and actions can still be judged good or bad, but they are evaluated in the context of whether they help you or not and not in the context of mortality. Therefore someone who is selfless, kind, and honest is considered good because they are less likely to harm you, while those who take pleasure in hurting others, lying, and death are more likely to harm you and are therefore bad. When expanded to the societal level, this creates cultural and social norms and laws, which are just a product of the people living in it (what people view as good and bad based on that brain chemistry) rather than some moral absolute. People are punished not because it\u2019s fair or moral, but because of power from collective interest.\n\nSo in practice, I understand that this shouldn\u2019t change most of how we live our lives\u2014we still undeniably have the illusion of choice, and shouldn\u2019t just let go of all accountability of ourselves. People should still be punished, and order should still be held. However, if we want to \u201crationally\u201d maintain some construct of fairness, rather than viewing some people as good or bad, lesser or more, based on their character (those thoughts, urges, and actions), we have empathy by realizing everyone just is a person and a product of things out of their control. Rather than demonizing \u201cevil\u201d and casting them aside with 0 remorse, it\u2019s something we look at with pity in that they were dealt a life of pain and suffering, both in what they received and caused. It\u2019s reasonable to think \u201cI would rather have this person on this earth than that person to live with for a happier life\u201d but unreasonable to think \u201cI am better than this person because if I were in their exact circumstance and had their same experience I would pick the more socially acceptable option\u201d because according to this model, you really wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s basically impossible to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes as an exercise to think that that person should have taken a different action. Likewise, for people that are a stereotypical \u201csaint,\u201d that is the hand they were dealt. \n\nVery interested in hearing counterpoints from the scientific and philosophical angle, as admittedly it\u2019s the best model of humanity that I can think of (and I\u2019m not a philosopher so I probably can\u2019t think of a lot). Also admittedly, this probably does sound like a big religion influenced-\u201ceveryone deserves love\u201d idea, which I\u2019m sure has some criticism. Thanks everyone!\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses. In doing so I think I may have made an error in how I phrased the topic statement\u2014my premises are the same though. To avoid replying in a very long post to everyone interested in discussing, I\u2019ll reframe here:\n\nPremise 1: The universe (and therefore human life)is predetermined. If we scientifically and mathematically proved today that the universe was predetermined, I would say this finding would be unsurprising as it is the most likely conclusion based on what we know of the universe already. To change my view, this probably requires some sort of scientific argument.\n\nPremise 2: Knowing this is the way of the world will not change your life in any way, nor our legal or societal structure. You cannot effectively use the fact that the universe is predetermined to justify any decision that you\u2019re making. You still feel the same emotions, feel the same quality of unfairness and what is reasonable\u2014whether they are predetermined or not doesn\u2019t matter in how you live your life. To change my view, this requires you to accept the hypothetical that we found out that the universe is predetermined and nothing else, and that in some way, life for you is now a completely different paradigm to what you were doing before. To me, the experience is the same\u2014you can\u2019t actually do anything with it because you can just as easily say \u201cI was fated to do this\u201d and do it as you can say \u201cI was fated not to do this\u201d and do the other thing. For all intents and purposes you still have to live like you have choices, things can still be reasonable, and things can still seem fair.\n\nPremise 3: Assuming you accepted the first two premises, I would argue that hatred/idolization of people are not a rational way to think about people\u2014ie the premise of this person is just inherently bad or evil or good doesn\u2019t make any sense. Of course people can still feel them because they are biologically driven, like lust or excitement, but when I step back and reason about it, there is no logical argument for why you could sustain hatred/disgust for another person. The only thing that pops out is that some people are more beneficial/more disadvantageous to your experience than others. You can still have enemies and people that are antithetical to your experience, but at the end of the day they are only doing what they think is right just as you are\u2014in another set of initialization variables, you would have done the same thing as your enemy. Everyone is just moving forward the way and doing what they believe to be best in the way that their biological code dictates. True good and evil no longer exist\u2014just human suffering and the absence of it. To change my view, one probably has to accept that the first two premises are true, and argue that it is still reasonable to hate someone, or think that people are still inherently evil in a way that is separate from believing they are just more dangerous to you and society.", "time": 1711947340.0, "comments": ["/u/Delicious-Schedule-4 (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1btmcqy/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_judging_peoples_character/), in /r/DeltaLog.\n\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)", "If people don't have a choice about being evil, I don't have a choice about demonizing them for it.", "Interesting. \n&gt; make a post claiming actions are predestined\n\n&gt; makes judgement that says judging people based on said actions is unreasonable and unfair\n\n&gt; doesn\u2019t see the irony \n\nAny argument that you have to support is kind of just arguing for predestined actions.

I grew up low-income and in a high-crime area and I'll be the first one to say those who harm others repeatedly are shitty people.

For example, if someone is just a serial cheater regardless of their upbringing, it's just kind of a shitty thing to do. You absolutely can judge them for their character.

The only practical solution to this issue is assuming the universe is not predetermined.", "If we assume that your model of human behavior is correct then I would posit that this greatly increases the value of judging people's character even more harshly.\n\nIf people are simply a sum of their external stimuli and their brain chemistry we are highly motivated to ensure that poor brain chemistry isn't passed down to more offspring. Furthermore if people who are \"evil\" can in turn make other people \"evil\" based upon being bad external stimuli we would want to ensure that no one is modeling bad behavior.\n\nIf fact getting rid of evil in the world would just be an exercise in tightly controlling people's behavior and brain chemistry. The problem is that the act of tightly controlling people's behavior / brain chemistry is antithetical to the human spirit.\n\nIf we assume people have no control over their actions it does not follow that we should not judge people for their actions. Part of teaching people is showing that some actions have really bad consequences and you shouldn't do them. Just like learning to read or behave in social situations you need to learn how not to behave in social situations.\n\nIn fact the act of judging someone is modeling the behavior that we as a society wants. We should not say that the person who murdered 10,000 people is the same as the person who spends their free time teaching children. Even if the person who murdered 10,000 people had a bad childhood. We want to encourage people to spend their free time teaching children. \n\nIn conclusion even if people don't have control over their actions it does not follow that judging people for their actions is unreasonable.

While it's true that these factors play a significant role in shaping behavior, it suggests that individuals have no responsibility for their actions.  \nMy counterarguments: \n\n1. Free will is still argued whether we even have it or not, even though science can help us understand how things like our brain and environment affect our decisions, we're still not sure if free will really exists. Just because these factors have an impact on our choices doesn't mean that free will isn't real. For me personally i believe i have free will.  For example: although we have laws to follow, I still could break that said law if I wanted. I would just suffer the consequences. Although you could argue that those consequences hinder my free will, I still had the CHOICE to commit a crime.  \n2. Personal growth and change are a huge argument you can make against people not having a choice over their character. Although our upbringing, genes, and environment can shape us, we still can grow and change as individuals. At least for me I have changed overall from who i was in high school, opposed to who I am now in college. Keep in mind when I choose a college away from home essentially, I was able to pick whoever i wanted to be because didn't know anyone, so being able to do so that allow is growth in recognizing i needed to change some of my \u201cchildish\u201d behaviors as i was evolving.  Through experiences, education, and thinking about ourselves, and lastly therapy, we can develop new attitudes and behaviors that are different from what we started with. This shows that we're not completely controlled by our circumstances.  \n \u20603. Having empathy and understanding that human behavior is complicated and influenced by many different things. However, having both of those can help contribute to a different perspective on people\u2019s character. It's important to hold people accountable for what they do, but knowing what influences their behavior can help us be more compassionate and make better judgments. For example, the Drake Bell situation \u201cIn 2021, Bell pleaded guilty to a felony charge of attempted child endangerment and a misdemeanor charge of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles\u201d (Stenzel, 2024). He was bashed (to be fair I would\u2019ve too) all over the internet to the point he moved to Mexico, but now with the documentary \u2018Quiet on Set\u2019 I have seen a drastic change in how people talk about him. They even sympathize with him (rightfully so, with all he\u2019s endured). If Drake Bell never spoke the truth, I personally don\u2019t believe people would be rooting for him. Those who didn\u2019t judge him may not have any opinion on either of the situations he was involved in, but those who did and now root for him prove that people could change their opinions, so it wouldn\u2019t be fair to say that they had no control over their change in opinion.  \nalthough things outside of our control can affect how we behave, it's too board to say that we have no control over our actions. We should recognize that things like our brain chemistry and the environment can influence us, but we should also focus on the fact that we can make choices and grow as individuals. As I am sure you have experienced yourself possibly (:", "Well, by your logic, I also have no control over Judging their character.

If you cannot judge people over their character (since they have no choice) - you also cannot complain about judging (because judgers also have no choice in formation of judgements).", "While brain chemistry and external factors influence behavior, humans possess agency through consciousness and decision-making processes. Moral responsibility acknowledges individual accountability within societal frameworks. Empathy and understanding mitigate harsh judgments but don't absolve individuals of consequences. Recognizing inherent complexities in human behavior doesn't negate personal responsibility or moral standards. Humans strive for growth, learning, and self-improvement, influenced by both nature and nurture but capable of transcending deterministic models. While acknowledging the role of circumstance, society functions on principles of accountability, justice, and ethical behavior, fostering trust and cohesion. Embracing empathy doesn't preclude holding individuals accountable for their actions and striving for collective progress. Balancing empathy with accountability promotes fairness and societal harmony, fostering personal growth and social cohesion.", "[removed]", "If by reasonable and fair you mean moral, if you see the world from a utilitarian perspective, the greatest amount of happiness in a society occurs when behavior that  inhibits it's smooth functioning is discouraged. Shame, judgement from others and punishment are good tools for discouraging \"bad\" behavior. It doesn't matter if that behavior results from free will or is predetermined. \n\nAt the extreme it's almost like you're saying if someone is having a psychotic break and coming after you with a weapon you shouldn't use deadly force if necessary to protect yourself. . .because they have no control. Your fear and aggression are both reasonable and fair.", "Judgement is essentially applying a subjective label on something objective. It's perfectly reasonable. It's a very effective tool used to help us navigate situations. I don't think it necessarily matters *why* something is \"bad\" -- if it's bad then, well, maybe it should be avoided. \n\nUnfortunately, life is not fair. It doesn't always matter *why* something it the way it is... it may not be fair, but it's surely *useful* for me to judge something and avoid it.\n\nI don't see why having \"control\" over something is necessary for it not to be judged. Maybe we can make accommodations, or judge some parts but not others.", "Why isn't the fact that character and past decisions are the best evidence I have for someone's future behavior enough of a reason to for judgments? If I am interacting with someone, I need to make evaluations of how they are likely to behave in what circumstances. Their past behavior is the best indicator for that. What's illegitimate about using it as such?", "&gt;Things and actions can still be judged good or bad, but they are evaluated in the context of whether they help you or not\n\nI would consider this your moral framework. It's not that moral judgements of character are unreasonable, it's just that they should be done through the lens of utility, like you describe.", "At the end of the day, most people are aware of societal rules.

Sometimes highly-engaged threads will be deleted out of the blue with no or minimal rule violations, with some ambiguous \"common topic\" explanation or something like that.  Other times, blatant rule-breaking will stay up after multiple reports.\n\nCould be my own biases, but it seems that the key difference in whether some threads stay up or get taken down is whether the mods like the topics or not and/or whether the mods agree with where the conversation on the topic is going.", "Is there any guidance on the amount of interaction needed to prevent a Rule E removal?

And in relation, is this ok when people soapbox for OP\u2019s view in the comment?\n\nI guess my point is that sometimes in popular topic, the comment section lose track that the goal is to challenge OP\u2019s view and not convince people that OP\u2019s is right and while on harmless subject, it\u2019s fun, when the topic is heavier, then it becomes weird when you have people not only defending but trying to consolidate OP\u2019s problematic view.", "[removed]", "One thing I've noticed is the mod team's general hesitance to award contextual deltas. As in, when an OP responds with what would normally be a delta award, except they don't actually put the delta-awarding phrase in their comment, so the delta never gets awarded. The comment gets reported for Rule 4 as it should, and a mod responds afterward saying \"remember to award a delta in your response.\"\n\nThere have been a handful of times where I've seen an OP's comment exactly like this, with a mod's delta reminder reply after it. Except instead of the delay being an hour or two, it's upwards of 18 hours or more. By that point, it's not really reasonable to assume OP is still active in their thread (they very well could be, but in my experience this is rarely the case), so the person who would have otherwise received the delta ends up not getting one.\n\nMy question is, how long does the \"delta reminder clock\" last? How long does a comment have to stay up for a mod to say \"Okay, enough time has passed, it's unlikely the OP will bother coming back to edit in the delta, I will award to the OP's respondee for them\"?", "I still post in this subreddit regularly because it does have worthwhile discussions, but the userbase here is so overwhelmingly left leaning that I think it detracts from the stated purpose of the subreddit.\n\nThe problem, which is omnipresent, is that an opinion which deviates from the left leaning consensus will be barraged with downvotes and strong disagreement. Meanwhile, opinions which affirm that consensus, which are frequent, are treated with kid gloves. There's an echo chamber effect going on which isn't in line with the goal of understanding views we disagree with.\n\nPersonally, I find this annoying enough that I have unsubscribed from the subreddit.

You guys do your job well, and we all benefit from it.", "What's the procedure on someone who seems to have had their view changed by a comment, but edits their OP to say \"well I should have also added X and Y\" instead of awarding a delta to the person who prompted that change?
