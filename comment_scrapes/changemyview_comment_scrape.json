Are they hunting another species to the degree that they are extincting them and/or causing a major disruption in the food chain?

It claims the vast majority of deaths in the conflict are civilians, and is frequently used to justify claims of genocide against Israel. The current number stands at around 32k Dead, of whom half are minors. \n\nHere's the thing, the number is wrong. I think people directly quoting the number are making a mistake. It's wrong. It's obviously wrong. But, the specific way it's wrong is awkward for everyone. \n\nThe reason why is this. The GMH Talley is accurately tracking confirmed deaths. Most of the people on the list (there's an actual list of names) are dead. It's just undercounting the actual death toll.\n\nIt's awkward for Hamas because: \n\nHamas and \"resistance\" deaths are not being accurately tracked in the page. The list is exclusively composed of people reported to the ministry or who ended up in the hospital. There's basically no evidence Hamas/PIJ is telling the GHM accurate casualty tallies. \n\nSoldier/terrorists lost behind the lines, killed in airstrikes, buried in collapsed tunnels, are not being added to the list. The 7-8k Missing category that the GHM mentions is probably disproportionately fighting age males. \n\nOne of the clearest indicators of this is the fact that terrorists killed during the Oct. 7 offensive do not seem to show up on the list. We know that between 500 and 2000 fighters died in \"67 Israel\" during the offensive, but the early list didn't \"jump\" at the start with fight-age male losses. \n\nThe incentive for \"the Resistance\" is obvious. They plan to claim victory/they fought off Israel after the war ends. It's the same reason they publish their absurdly fake Talley of Israeli casualties and the videos of RPG ambushes that don't show impact. They can't honestly admit to the Palastinian people that 2/3rds of their battalions have been smashed. \n\nIt's awkward for Israel because:\n\nIsrael actually has killed an absolute fuck ton of civilians. The ratio isn't quite as lopsided as the GMH Talley suggests. But 12k dead Palastinian children is a lot. The evidence that they've killed so many people is extremely well documented and the attempts to deny it or claim it's staged are really emberassing lies. \n\nThe thing is, Israel is probably aware of this. They do go around claiming the GMH is false, but they can't actually admit that the real reason why is that it's just incomplete. \n\nTechnically speaking, if Israel actually has killed 10k-15k resistance fighters and 25k-30k civilians, this isn't a *good* Soldier-Civilian death ratio. The US broadly achieved 2:1 in the seige of Mosul, so Israel with 1:1.5 - 1:3 still raises a bunch of uncomfortable questions. But, the fact they can't admit this leaves them open to the GMH charge of something ludicrous like 1:6 or worse. A 1:2 ratio is an exceedingly bloody war, but within defensible bounds. A 1:6 ratio is a much more credible genocide allegation. \n\nConclusion:\n\nWe're left with the Gaza Ministry number because it's the only Talley of the dead that's detailed and data driven. It's not a lie, but it should not be taken as a representative. It's still useful as an absolute floor of deaths. Still, I don't think people should be using it to actually discuss the death ratio in Gaza.", "comments": ["/u/WinterinoRosenritter (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1bss5t1/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_the_gaza_health_ministry/), in /r/DeltaLog.\n\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)", "Slight correction (depending on who you\u2019re sourcing): many are in agreement that far more died in Mosul ([and Iraq as a whole](https://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/ten-years/)) than originally reported. 174,000:39,900 civilian:combatant for the whole war.\n\nUrban warfare is impossible to avoid civilians.

Say they\u2019re both more understandable than other dialects ignoring intra-comparisons, the point is simply certain dialects are more applicable in a global context than others, forming the basis of the argument.", "comments": ["/u/OkKindheartedness769 (OP) has awarded 3 delta(s) in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1bswgdj/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_some_dialects_are_better/), in /r/DeltaLog.\n\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)", "I speak a different English at my job (American academic) than the English I grew up with (Indiana red neck). The mutual intelligibility of the two differs vastly based upon the context of communication I\u2019m having. A lot of communication lies in cultural awareness and the ability to mold language to the moment appropriately. \n\nAn anecdote from Siberia: I lived there awhile and met several folks trying to learn English or teach it. Given the geographic position of the region, they taught with a hybrid of various Anglo dialects. The US-British-Aussie dialect ended up being much clearer for me as a speaker of American English than pure British Standard English. By teaching English from the various perspectives of the Anglo world, the students had a very clear (but unspecialized, dialectically) form of English. My experience with Anglo fusion here makes me question your take on dialects. \n\nIs a dialect really able to become the clearest of them all? My experience shows a fusion is the clearest way to communicate. Dialectic specialization is great given a person\u2019s desire to live/work in a specific area. If the desire is to learn a versatile English, devoting oneself to one dialect may hinder growth and overall understanding of the language. Learning the language enough to move between dialects is a huge sign of mastery, yet a standard point should come before multi-dialectic mastery can be achieved. \n\nPerhaps because there are so many dialects of English, only a hybrid stands the chance of being the most intelligible. The lack of standard in hybrid English is its strength in being most widely understood. \n\nIf a Siberian student of English went up against a south Londoner and a Pittsburgher, I\u2019d imagine they\u2019d understand more than the pittsburgher or s Londoner would alone.", "This post kind of doesn\u2019t argue what the title says. It more argues that British English has more reach- and is better understood broadly. That\u2019s a little more nuanced than just being \u201cbetter\u201d\n\nBut I think your premise is also probably wrong in today\u2019s world. There definitely has been a reach that British English has had historically- but in 2024? Hollywood and American cultural media has dominated the last century in a way that British media just\u2026 hasn\u2019t? \n\nIf there\u2019s a standard English nowadays, it\u2019s far more likely to be the American one that\u2019s evoked in people\u2019s minds.", "It\u2019s kind of like arguing vanilla is the best ice cream.", "Hi OP:\n\nYou make some interesting arguments ngl, but let me make an ***unconventional one*** (since your update already clarified that American English bit)\n\nyou are looking at a strictly utilitarian viewpoint; a language is only good if it provides a service. Let me ask you something that hopefully isn't too personal: did you grow up working-class OP? If so, it doesn't surprise me! I'm a linguistic nerd, but I also grew up working class and ended up surrounded by a bunch of people who aren't, and I think I get what you're saying and where you're coming from. My argument isn't going to be based on utility or linguistic merit; simply **on taste.** I'm just going to use 3 examples OP, it might be a long post but I promise it's worth it. The three examples are going to be food, music, and art.\n\nSome context:\n\nThere's this dude named Pierre Bourdieu, and his work is kind of a hard concept to grasp. Basically, he argues that how we perceive ANYTHING is based on cultural factors, such as upbringing, education, and socioeconomic factors. I'll use myself as an example: I grew up eating a lot of spicy foods. Now, I eat a lot of spicy foods as an adult while some of my friends (who never touched the stuff growing up) still don't touch it as adults. Easy to follow along yeah? Ok, now let's do music.\n\nSay you grew up listening to rap; you can have phenomenally talented rappers who incorporate/master many aspects of music. Who is someone to say it's a trash genre compared to Mozart? This is an example of taste being a barrier to perception. There's merit in both, but one might just not see any of the merit in the other. I know people who call classical boring, I know people who call rap crap. They're both sheltered in their own way, I'm not going to get into the complexities of music, but just keep their adamancy in mind.\n\nThis \"taste barrier\" can also be seen in food, where Mexican food is looked down upon and things like french/italian cuisine is put on a pedastol. Both have merit and just because one is more popular and valued to different people doesn't make it better than the other; chef Anthony Bourdain (RIP GOAT) even recognized this. On a similar note; 2PAC is looked down upon while Mozart is also on that pedestal for similar reasons.\n\nThe last example I'm giving is about art. look at home decor: The rich get wild, crazy stuff in their place that serves no purpose, and it's \"artistic,\" while when the working class does it, it's \"tacky\" or just a knack. Fashion is also different. Think of leather jackets and cardigans; I learned that the working class values utility more than anything.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say OP is that  really more than popularity that makes a language **better**. POP is the most popular music in the world, but that **doesn't make it the best type of music** in the world. Hopefully you get what I'm trying to say here bud.\n\nBut if you think that one language can be better than most; then you also have to agree things like French food being the best in the world and pop music being the best in the world simply because there's a good chance most people won't hate it...which is a hot take imo but if that's your take so be it. But I will say if that still is your stance, you're missing out.  What makes all that stuff great is that you can enjoy a lot of it. You don't need to limit yourself to just one. Yeah, it's definitely fun to know more than one language; you get a whole new world open to you. The same is said about different dialects; hell, look at Obama. He was able to unite the country speaking two tongues\n\nthank you for reading"]}, {"title": "CMV: Despite denying it, the US government started the crack epidemic.", "description": "[deleted]", "comments": ["To /u/HuntPuzzleheaded4356, *your post is under consideration for removal under our post rules.*\r\n\r\nYou must **respond substantively within 3 hours of posting**, as per [Rule E](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_e).", "This is one of those \"I don't have any evidence, it just feels that way\" conspiracy sorts of CMV. None of what you said is evidence or logical deduction; it's supposition and unsupported assertion.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;You can\u2019t tell me a government that is all of a sudden so laissez-faire with drugs didn\u2019t start the crack epidemic.\n\n\n... Why not? Portugal famously decriminalized all drugs years before this shift in American policy. Did Portugal also have a ln urban crack epidemic that they started? Did every country and province that followed suit?\n\n\nPolicies change. That's government. Hell, life changes. People look at something that isn't working and say \"what can we do instead?\" It's not a conspiracy, it's literally governance\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, the same people in power in the 80's are not running the entire country top to bottom. (Inb4 McConnell and Biden are old. Yes, but 99% of government has changed over) There are different decision makers making different decisions. There is nothing weird about that whatsoever.\u00a0\n\n\nHow silly would it be to say \"you can't tell me that the same government that that would not acknowledge gay people is now ok with it.\" Very silly. A government is not a stubborn human; it is literally just the sum of the people who govern. And again, there are different people governing. So it only makes sense that the sun adds up to a different result.\n\n\n&gt;where was this sympathy for crack users in the 80s and 90s\n\n\nThat's part of what changed. Society and eventually some elements of government started looking at it through a lens of \"how can we actually fix or alleviate this expensive, pervasive problem\" instead of \"how can we punish undesirable people\" because it wasn't working for literally anybody except the prison industry.\n\n\n&gt;If a government can go from locking people up for crack to enabling drug users then they definitely put crack in the hood\n\n\nAgain, this is not evidence or anything really. One can say \"if the government can lock up Japanese-Americans during WWII, then they are definitely genociding whomever they want\"\n\n\n\"If the government can secretly dose people with LSD, then they definitely put microchips in vaccines\"\n\n\nAnd so on\n\n\nIt doesn't mean those things are happening, are likely to be happening, and in fact means nothing at all. It's an empty statement posing as a logical conclusion that is actually a non-sequitur", "Well, for starters, you haven't presented any evidence for your thesis.  Even if everything you say is true it isn't evidence the government _started_ the crack epidemic in the 80s.\n\nBut putting that aside, the evolution in policy you are seeing is an evolution of our understanding of drug use, its impact on society, and how to effectively lower harm.  \n\nIn the 80's/90's we were scared of rising crime rates associated with drug use and we decided that severe criminalization and law enforcement was the way to solve that problem.  People honestly thought cities would end up like they were depicted in _RoboCop_ - crime-ridden hellscapes where drug kingpins were more powerful than politicians.\n\nIn the decades that followed, we saw those policies were less effective than we had hoped.  Many feel that the \"war on drugs\" has been an abject failure, doing little to curb drug use and being responsible for the changing role of police in our society, including their militarization.  This says nothing about the impact those laws have had on many communities.\n\nSo folks are trying a different tactic.  Rather than treating drug use as a crime, they are treating it as an illness.  Safe injection sites, readily accessible OD mediation, testing strips, etc. are all policies to help mitigate the damage that drugs can do to the user.  We've accepted that folks who are doing drugs _are going to keep doing drugs_ so we are trying to make it as safe as possible while (hopefully) giving them access to resource to get clean.\n\nYou can disagree with this change in policy, and I'll be the first to say we don't know yet if this change will be effective.  However, that change in approach is not evidence that the government is behind or responsible for drug usage.", "&gt;You can\u2019t tell me a government that is all of a sudden so laissez-faire with drugs didn\u2019t start the crack epidemic.\n\nClassic reddit \"I have absolutely no proof but I have iron clad opinions and you can't change them\""]}, {"title": "CMV: All men are depraved", "description": "[deleted]", "comments": ["/u/SakuraYanfuyu (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1bssz1h/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_all_men_are_depraved/), in /r/DeltaLog.\n\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)", "Do you believe every single man is depraved?

Yeah it's good to pay people for their work, and technically legally speaking it is illegal to make copies of certain things if you don't have permission to make copies of those things. But it is still different from taking it. There's no material reason that making a copy of a digital good should be a problem, because making copies of digital things is free, it doesn't require additional labor. Rather, we just have a social construct that making copies of things without permission is not allowed because otherwise the market for digital goods wouldn't function", "this is only true if you believe that the law has some intrinsic value meriting it's own enforcement. for an extreme example, it was illegal to harbor jews in Nazi germany. no matter how justified the people who chose to do so were, it was still a crime. should they have been punished? \n\nnow, obviously, piracy is nowhere near as serious, nor as black and white a moral issue, but the principle remains the same: should laws be enforced and criminals punished regardless of justification for their actions.\n\nthat said, based on your cmv, i suspect that your view isn't particularly hinged on the enforcement of laws, but rather on the criminality of piracy. as examples, you provide instances of regular theft, but i disagree that it's a perfectly analogous situation. in theft, you are depriving someone of property, which isn't true of piracy. piracy, at its core, relies on the \\*copying\\* of media. the owner of that piece of media is not actually deprived of anything, and is exactly as well off as they were prior to an instance of piracy. the legal basis of copyright is then based not on actual deprivation of property, but rather on the idea that people are entitled to the profits of their own creations, and piracy deprives them of that. \n\nbut that's where things get ethically grey. does any individual act of piracy deprive the rights holder of the profits from their creation? that varies. for instance, many people pirate games that have been out of print for decades. no matter how much you want it, nintendo \\*will not\\* sell you a copy of pokemon emerald for the gameboy. so in pirating the game, have you actually caused harm? or maybe you're on the fence about buying a game since you're tight on money, and you choose to pirate it as a sort of demo, leading to your choice to purchase the game legitimately. was there harm?", "Is pirating series you cannot legally watch immoral? Is immoral pirating a 30 year old game that nobody sells anymore?", "Is your argument that if a law exists you should have to follow it regardless of how silly it may seem?", "It's not a crime because the law doesn't define it as a crime (except in very specific cases). Yes, it's illegal, but illegal and criminal are different concepts which only overlap somewhat.\n\nA good example of what I'm talking about is Flag Code (4 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 - \u00a7 10) which lays out the specific rules for how the US Flag is composed and displayed. There's a LOT of rules about this and if you do it wrong, even accidentally, it's illegal. Will anyone get in any trouble for this? No.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the law just explains *how* to do flag. Not what happens if you do flag wrong.\n\nCompare and contrast with something which *is* a crime. I'll use the popular happy fun crime of murder (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1111).\n\n\\[Pedant: this is the Federal statute under which you'd only be prosecuted if you were in a state park, on Federal property, out to sea but outside of the jurisdiction of any state, crossed state lines during the crime, a few other specific circumstances, or because they felt like it.\\]\n\nIf you read the statute, it's split into three easy to read sections:\n\n* a: They explain what constitutes a murder and define a first-degree and second-degree version of murder.\n* b: (This is the bit which separates 'illegal' from 'criminal'.) They explain what happens to a person found guilty of having committed a murder.\n* c: They specifically define a few words which appear in the statute to prevent ambiguity and clarify the intent of the law.\n\nInternet piracy is generally (but not always) a civil issue, not a criminal one. In most cases, you're not facing jailtime or execution. Only a civil judgement, maybe an injunction. Your only risk of jailtime is repeatedly flipping the bird to the judge but that's under Contempt of Court, not Copyright.\n\nTo be clear, there *are* cases where it's a crime but most of those wouldn't really involve the internet enough that someone would specifically refer to it as \"internet piracy\", only as \"piracy\". A good example of this would be the wholesale bulk duplication of CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, and Betamax tapes, and then selling them at the swap meet.\n\nThe $250k fine and 6 months of jailtime isn't because your nerdy cousin downloaded Avengers off of BitTorrent. But the site hosting that torrent and thousands of others, and also running trackers which are seeding the torrents? That would cross the threshold into criminal piracy.

I believe a person\u2019s character is defined by their thoughts, urges, and actions, which in turn is just a product of two things: brain chemistry and external stimuli. Upon receiving an external stimulus (which could be outwardly physical like the five senses or mental like a thought or emotion), the brain produces an output, like a thought, urge, or action, and then rewires itself based on the perceived reward (how good/bad something feels, also based on neurochemistry). As a person grows, this brain chemistry and input-output relationship becomes progressively built upon and defines what a person will do, think, or feel at any given moment. The state a person ends up in is thus defined by their starting brain chemistry, the method of rewiring, (both genetic/nature) and the environment they are in (circumstantial/nurture). This is just my understanding from my limited knowledge of how the brain learns, with some concepts from reinforcement learning thrown in\u2014very open to believing this could be wrong. But in this framework there is only the illusion of control and not control itself.\n\nFor example, imagine you had infinite computing power and some incredible simulation tools that could create a computational learning agent that would interact with a dynamic world around it. You initialize like a thousand of these agents by putting them in different environments with different starting variables, and let them loose and observe (to be fair this is almost already a reality!) The programmers/observers would likely say that any behavior is not under any moral guidelines, and understand that an agent\u2019s output and action are just a product of the code/math, randomness, and the environment. To me, our DNA operates extremely similarly, with a similar conclusion to be drawn about our behavior. If a person commits first degree murder or another heinous crime, they had no control over whether they would have the thoughts to commit the crime, or whether they lacked the neural guardrails to prevent them from doing it. Less drastically, many don\u2019t view addiction as a moral failure, because it\u2019s just brain chemistry\u2014some are inevitably more susceptible than others. Likewise if someone is \u201cmorally good\u201d it can be argued that they were just lucky that the product of their brain chemistry and environment aligned with societal values.\n\nThings and actions can still be judged good or bad, but they are evaluated in the context of whether they help you or not and not in the context of mortality. Therefore someone who is selfless, kind, and honest is considered good because they are less likely to harm you, while those who take pleasure in hurting others, lying, and death are more likely to harm you and are therefore bad. When expanded to the societal level, this creates cultural and social norms and laws, which are just a product of the people living in it (what people view as good and bad based on that brain chemistry) rather than some moral absolute. People are punished not because it\u2019s fair or moral, but because of power from collective interest.\n\nSo in practice, I understand that this shouldn\u2019t change most of how we live our lives\u2014we still undeniably have the illusion of choice, and shouldn\u2019t just let go of all accountability of ourselves. People should still be punished, and order should still be held. However, if we want to \u201crationally\u201d maintain some construct of fairness, rather than viewing some people as good or bad, lesser or more, based on their character (those thoughts, urges, and actions), we have empathy by realizing everyone just is a person and a product of things out of their control. Rather than demonizing \u201cevil\u201d and casting them aside with 0 remorse, it\u2019s something we look at with pity in that they were dealt a life of pain and suffering, both in what they received and caused. It\u2019s reasonable to think \u201cI would rather have this person on this earth than that person to live with for a happier life\u201d but unreasonable to think \u201cI am better than this person because if I were in their exact circumstance and had their same experience I would pick the more socially acceptable option\u201d because according to this model, you really wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s basically impossible to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes as an exercise to think that that person should have taken a different action. Likewise, for people that are a stereotypical \u201csaint,\u201d that is the hand they were dealt. \n\nVery interested in hearing counterpoints from the scientific and philosophical angle, as admittedly it\u2019s the best model of humanity that I can think of (and I\u2019m not a philosopher so I probably can\u2019t think of a lot). Also admittedly, this probably does sound like a big religion influenced-\u201ceveryone deserves love\u201d idea, which I\u2019m sure has some criticism. Thanks everyone!\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses. In doing so I think I may have made an error in how I phrased the topic statement\u2014my premises are the same though. To avoid replying in a very long post to everyone interested in discussing, I\u2019ll reframe here:\n\nPremise 1: The universe (and therefore human life)is predetermined. If we scientifically and mathematically proved today that the universe was predetermined, I would say this finding would be unsurprising as it is the most likely conclusion based on what we know of the universe already. To change my view, this probably requires some sort of scientific argument.\n\nPremise 2: Knowing this is the way of the world will not change your life in any way, nor our legal or societal structure. You cannot effectively use the fact that the universe is predetermined to justify any decision that you\u2019re making. You still feel the same emotions, feel the same quality of unfairness and what is reasonable\u2014whether they are predetermined or not doesn\u2019t matter in how you live your life. To change my view, this requires you to accept the hypothetical that we found out that the universe is predetermined and nothing else, and that in some way, life for you is now a completely different paradigm to what you were doing before. To me, the experience is the same\u2014you can\u2019t actually do anything with it because you can just as easily say \u201cI was fated to do this\u201d and do it as you can say \u201cI was fated not to do this\u201d and do the other thing. For all intents and purposes you still have to live like you have choices, things can still be reasonable, and things can still seem fair.\n\nPremise 3: Assuming you accepted the first two premises, I would argue that hatred/idolization of people are not a rational way to think about people\u2014ie the premise of this person is just inherently bad or evil or good doesn\u2019t make any sense. Of course people can still feel them because they are biologically driven, like lust or excitement, but when I step back and reason about it, there is no logical argument for why you could sustain hatred/disgust for another person. The only thing that pops out is that some people are more beneficial/more disadvantageous to your experience than others. You can still have enemies and people that are antithetical to your experience, but at the end of the day they are only doing what they think is right just as you are\u2014in another set of initialization variables, you would have done the same thing as your enemy. Everyone is just moving forward the way and doing what they believe to be best in the way that their biological code dictates. True good and evil no longer exist\u2014just human suffering and the absence of it. To change my view, one probably has to accept that the first two premises are true, and argue that it is still reasonable to hate someone, or think that people are still inherently evil in a way that is separate from believing they are just more dangerous to you and society.", "comments": ["/u/Delicious-Schedule-4 (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1btmcqy/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_judging_peoples_character/), in /r/DeltaLog.\n\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)", "If people don't have a choice about being evil, I don't have a choice about demonizing them for it.", "Interesting. \n&gt; make a post claiming actions are predestined\n\n&gt; makes judgement that says judging people based on said actions is unreasonable and unfair\n\n&gt; doesn\u2019t see the irony \n\nAny argument that you have to support is kind of just arguing for predestined actions.
