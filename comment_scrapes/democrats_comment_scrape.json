In the 1890's, Svante Arrhenius was studying the effects of gasses.  He modeled, surprisingly accurately, how the earth's temps would rise as carbon dioxide was added to the atmosphere.  It has been heavily studied since.  Vast amounts of that research was buried by corporations because they saw that global warming would hurt their profits.\n\nAnyway, check out science.nasa.gov as further evidence with actual science.", "Humans didn't necessarily cause it, but have accelerated the process significantly.

The \"scientists\" that the oil companies cite in their propaganda are almost all paid hacks from unrelated fields, e.g., engineers and chemists.", "So the climate change comes from carbon dioxid. Carbon dioxid is emitted by burning things. The concentration in the atmosphere got higher since humen started to burn coal. Very important is, that the carbon dioxide, that was burned has a lack of cabon dioxid with C14, the radioactive isotope of carbon (atually C12). The amount of C14 carbon dioxide did not rase like the amount of C12 carbon dioxide, so the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has to come from CO2 emitted by fossiles, because in fossiles can not be C12, because the radioactive isotope disappears by time. This is the proof that the raise of CO2 in he atmosphere is made by the human.\n\nAnother proof that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is rising are the oceans as carbon acid as well. When water gets hotter there is less Carbon acid in the water. Nomally. But you have to know that not only heat is important for the chemical balance. Concentration is important as well. Because of the higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere this effect does not happen, but the oceans are actually getting hotter and more acid. This is the second proof that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere must have risen.\n\nNow you may say that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is really low, but you have to calculate that this little amountof CO2 made it possible that there is actually life on earth because this low amount of CO2 has a significant influence on earth temperature. It is really bad that this amount is getting higher, because a significant change makes the earth get significant hotter.\n\nNot to mention other greenhouse gases.\n\nSo yes, climate change is definitely made by humen and it is definitely as dangerous as its said to be.", "**Bot message:** Help us make this a better community by clicking the \"report\" link on any memes, pics or vids that break [the sub's rules.](https://old.reddit.com/r/democrats/about/rules/) Thanks!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They\u2019re now laying the groundwork for a yearslong fight to curb in vitro fertilization.\n\nSince the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children, the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups have been strategizing how to convince not just GOP officials but evangelicals broadly that they should have serious moral concerns about fertility treatments like IVF and that access to them should be curtailed.\n\nThey plan to appeal to evangelical denominations and their leaders to take a firm stance that IVF as practiced in the U.S. destroys human life. That, they hope, will reshape how conservative Christians \u2014 and in turn, the officials they elect \u2014 view the issue, just as it did on abortion. Ultimately, it could lead to laws that create a patchwork of IVF access in the United States, where the procedure is more accessible in liberal states and more limited in conservative ones.\n\nOrganizations including Heritage, former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s group Advancing American Freedom, and the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s public advocacy-focused Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission have worked behind the scenes over the last few weeks to distribute talking points, circulate policy recommendations and educate Republican officials and their staff about their ethical concerns with how IVF is commonly practiced in the United States.\n\nThe groups are not advocating banning IVF but want new restrictions that would significantly curtail access to the procedure, such as imposing more regulations on fertility clinics, limiting the number of embryos that can be created or transferred to the uterus at one time, and banning pre-implantation genetic testing, which they argue allows parents to discriminate against their embryos on the basis of sex, disabilities like Down Syndrome or other factors.\n\nAt the same time, they have been having conversations within their conservative Christian circles that have revealed how much work they need to do to convince evangelicals that there are ethical problems with the procedure. Most evangelical denominations have not taken firm stances on restricting fertility services like IVF.", "time": 1711969956.0, "comments": []}, {"title": "Trump paid Kim Jong Un $2,000,000 after Kim slowly tortured Otto Warmbier to death.", "description": "", "time": 1711913514.0, "comments": ["Remember.

Democrats think they can now compete for a majority, but also that invigorated legislative campaigns can help turn out votes for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in November.\n\nThe Democrats argue there will be renewed personal attention to neighborhoods in small towns, suburbs and rural areas that had been part of GOP-heavy legislative seats but are now in more competitive districts. Those districts were seen as not worth the effort before, when Democrats\u2019 only hope was to stave off veto-proof GOP majorities. Now, they will get more campaign staff and volunteers to drive turnout.\n\nWisconsin is also among a half-dozen battleground states where Democrats are defending Senate seats in hopes of protecting their 51-49 majority. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, running for a third term, is likely to face millionaire businessman Eric Hovde who faces only nominal Republican opposition in the Aug. 13 primary.\n\nBaldwin agrees that she could benefit from \u201creverse coattails\u201d of legislative races. Previous districts \u201cwere so gerrymandered, which meant that there were whole swaths of Wisconsin where there weren\u2019t competitive races,\u201d she said.\n\nOf the Assembly\u2019s 99 seats, about half remain reasonably safe bets for Republicans. Democrats, who now hold 35 seats, have a better shot in 15 new districts. Some of those districts are on the outskirts of the Minnesota Twin Cities metro area in northwest Wisconsin and around Eau Claire to the northeast, both Democratic-leaning areas. Others are in the vote-rich Fox River Valley, including around Green Bay, where Trump plans to headline a rally on Tuesday.\n\nEven if Democrats fall short of the Assembly majority, Wikler figures that more aggressive canvassing for legislative candidates could identify people willing to vote Democratic in top-of-the-ticket races that have been tight in recent years.", "time": 1711901800.0, "comments": []}]
