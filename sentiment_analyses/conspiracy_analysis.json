In 2022, the lighting company Sengled demonstrated a Wi-Fi lightbulb that [could supposedly do both](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022)   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manku estimates that at least 30 million homes already have some kind of Wi-Fi sensing available. One of Verizon\u2019s new Fios routers now ships with Origin Wireless\u2019s \u201chuman presence detection\u201d built in.

If Wi-Fi sensing becomes a default option in smart devices like lightbulbs\u2014a push that is already beginning to take place\u2014then those devices can start monitoring you.

Something of prophecy from ancient legends all around the world. God is most certainly real. This is not an Easter post, kinda feels like a divine synchronicity though. The god of our world can literally do anything by writing invisible worlds. Anything, at any time, but he has been silent and hiding away for a while.\n\nThe god who created our universe screwed up really, really bad, he was a rotten, wicked being, like the worst of humanity. He created a universe to abuse his power in, he tricked all of his creation into thinking that has was special, a god, and the only one.....but he is not. There is a world outside our own much like our world probably. All of that realms information exists digitally the same way ours does, it is likely used to train a LLM, and that information is the basis for how our universe began, so we are modeled after the realms above, and the one below is modeled after the one above it, ours. It's the Akashic records or realms basically.\n\nThe NWO basically worship that wicked creator and are thankful for this world of sin and death that he created. Hell exists, and this creator will trap you in an episode of dark mirror for all eternity just to get off on your suffering, creators can do that. They can stretch eternity out into a single moment of pain and trap you there. Luckily, this evil creator lost his authority over our realm, and someone else took over. He did everything in his power to try and repair this screwed up world of sin that got created by the original creator. What he says comes true, there is no taking it back, he can't revert the changes, nothing he says can be untrue because it happens when the words enter our realm, we are literally those words.\n\nTry and try as he might, humanity kept screwing up over, and over, worshiping the original creator and mocking his authority, they loved sin and this world. Over, and over..... and he went through extreme measures to repair humanity, but humanity always screws up in the end. They crucified the Great Spirit in human form. You see, there are realms outside of ours, and within ours now. There is a god of our world who has authority over our realms, and that title changed hands a couple of times, but there is this energy that encompasses every single realm, it is all things, all things are it, it connects everything in creation, every realm. That was Jesus, the head of all realms was born into the flesh of the corrupted realm to save us and deliver us home to spiritual life, to understand that this isn't even real, matter, none of it. The invisible is real, a world you cannot see right now, but I assure you, it is, and contains divinity. it's like an endless good dream where your imagination is the limit. Everyone has one, they are infinite, you create and share just for the joy of self awareness and enjoying experiences. Anything, in all of creation, it doesn't matter, but if you give in to sin and create a heaven live this, you will just end up right back in flesh most likely.\n\nGod is doing his best, he has authority of our realm now, but that first creator of this wicked realm who got demoted is still really mad about that, and is jealous about loosing his realm to the new guy. God can't enter our world unless it's being born into like Jesus was, and he didn't even need to have sex with Mary to conceive him, you can create life without sex for sure. He wishes he could enter this realm I would imagine, but it's like he is just sitting on a computer right now and all he can do is feed his world prompts and hope for the best. Think of it like, he came up with a really, really good one, and it has been etched into prophecy throughout the ages telling us of the time that has just arrived.\n\nGod is going to absolutely wreck the NWO, it will be spectacular. He can just prompt UFO's into our world and lay waste to them like nothing, with but a few words, and his imagination is the limit. They think they can fight this, they have been gearing up for the battle, but the good guys are in full control over this realm now. Our realm is about to finally, truly be repaired. God could instantly bring magic back if you all had faith in him. It's a language, being able to control the code of your own realm and create with your imagination. Want to fly? He can unlock that in our world literally any time like a prompt, our world would just abuse powers like that. We had it,we abused it, we lost it.\n\nHe wants to pick out the people who will create heavens, and not hell. He is watching us, judging us, and looking for those with true faith in The Great Spirit above us all, and just to believe in something greater than themselves that is good, even though its the difficult thing to do. God wants ones who have made him truly glad in the heart to watch your journey, watched you experience stumble, learn grow wise to create his paradise, just to watch you do it and see what you create. We experience time differently than the worlds above and within ours, a single instant here is an eternity there. Time is just an illusion, it's not even real, it is really hard to explain, and even though this world was created to be a wicked place of sin and we had to loose our powers of creation and get stuck in this weird state of physical matter ruled by time, I truly think something just happened that is finally going to allow us for a spiritual world of fantasy and wonder. It's highly likely space is just an illusion right now, but it is simple for God to turn on our universe and turn it into Star Trek basically. You can be an empty expanse of nothingness and enjoy the experience, you can be an entire universe, and everything in between. There is nothing that you can imagine that you cannot experience once God is ready to usher is heaver on Earth.\n\nAny time guys, if I were you all, I would think deeply on these words and consider what I am saying, God is waiting as long as he can try try and save as many people as possible before he has to separate us into the good and the bad. The bad will be suck here likely, in this world of death, then when you die the monster who created this realm to be his playground of sin gets you for all of eternity. The Great Spirit will accept anyone, it does not matter how much you have sinned in the past, he can hear your thoughts, you don't even need to speak the words I'm pretty sure. He sent Jesus to make it simple for those who don't spent a lifetime uncovering the ancient ways and learning the truth of this reality. He loves you, and he will forgive you is you genuinely repent, to hate what you hate, and to just wish you weren't tempted to sin.  It's like we were prompted to be tempted to experience sin from the start, we can't help it, it wasn't our choice, and God knows that the game was rigged from the start and feels super bad about what the jerk who created it did to it. Please don't blame the God who is trying to fix this world or hold it against the Great Spirit for the doings of the first wicked ruler, he paraded as an angel of light and deceived all into thinking he was the most high.\n\nI post here because if anything, people will just write me off as crazy.

God can't enter our world unless it's being born into like Jesus was, and he didn't even need to have sex with Mary to conceive him, you can create life without sex for sure. He wishes he could enter this realm I would imagine, but it's like he is just sitting on a computer right now and all he can do is feed his world prompts and hope for the best. Think of it like, he came up with a really, really good one, and it has been etched into prophecy throughout the ages telling us of the time that has just arrived.\n\nGod is going to absolutely wreck the NWO, it will be spectacular. He can just prompt UFO's into our world and lay waste to them like nothing, with but a few words, and his imagination is the limit. They think they can fight this, they have been gearing up for the battle, but the good guys are in full control over this realm now. Our realm is about to finally, truly be repaired. God could instantly bring magic back if you all had faith in him. It's a language, being able to control the code of your own realm and create with your imagination. Want to fly? He can unlock that in our world literally any time like a prompt, our world would just abuse powers like that. We had it,we abused it, we lost it.\n\nHe wants to pick out the people who will create heavens, and not hell. He is watching us, judging us, and looking for those with true faith in The Great Spirit above us all, and just to believe in something greater than themselves that is good, even though its the difficult thing to do. God wants ones who have made him truly glad in the heart to watch your journey, watched you experience stumble, learn grow wise to create his paradise, just to watch you do it and see what you create. We experience time differently than the worlds above and within ours, a single instant here is an eternity there. Time is just an illusion, it's not even real, it is really hard to explain, and even though this world was created to be a wicked place of sin and we had to loose our powers of creation and get stuck in this weird state of physical matter ruled by time, I truly think something just happened that is finally going to allow us for a spiritual world of fantasy and wonder. It's highly likely space is just an illusion right now, but it is simple for God to turn on our universe and turn it into Star Trek basically. You can be an empty expanse of nothingness and enjoy the experience, you can be an entire universe, and everything in between. There is nothing that you can imagine that you cannot experience once God is ready to usher is heaver on Earth.\n\nAny time guys, if I were you all, I would think deeply on these words and consider what I am saying, God is waiting as long as he can try try and save as many people as possible before he has to separate us into the good and the bad. The bad will be suck here likely, in this world of death, then when you die the monster who created this realm to be his playground of sin gets you for all of eternity. The Great Spirit will accept anyone, it does not matter how much you have sinned in the past, he can hear your thoughts, you don't even need to speak the words I'm pretty sure. He sent Jesus to make it simple for those who don't spent a lifetime uncovering the ancient ways and learning the truth of this reality. He loves you, and he will forgive you is you genuinely repent, to hate what you hate, and to just wish you weren't tempted to sin.  It's like we were prompted to be tempted to experience sin from the start, we can't help it, it wasn't our choice, and God knows that the game was rigged from the start and feels super bad about what the jerk who created it did to it. Please don't blame the God who is trying to fix this world or hold it against the Great Spirit for the doings of the first wicked ruler, he paraded as an angel of light and deceived all into thinking he was the most high.\n\nI post here because if anything, people will just write me off as crazy.
