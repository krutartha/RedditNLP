It claims the vast majority of deaths in the conflict are civilians, and is frequently used to justify claims of genocide against Israel. The current number stands at around 32k Dead, of whom half are minors. \n\nHere's the thing, the number is wrong. I think people directly quoting the number are making a mistake. It's wrong. It's obviously wrong. But, the specific way it's wrong is awkward for everyone. \n\nThe reason why is this. The GMH Talley is accurately tracking confirmed deaths. Most of the people on the list (there's an actual list of names) are dead. It's just undercounting the actual death toll.\n\nIt's awkward for Hamas because: \n\nHamas and \"resistance\" deaths are not being accurately tracked in the page. The list is exclusively composed of people reported to the ministry or who ended up in the hospital. There's basically no evidence Hamas/PIJ is telling the GHM accurate casualty tallies. \n\nSoldier/terrorists lost behind the lines, killed in airstrikes, buried in collapsed tunnels, are not being added to the list. The 7-8k Missing category that the GHM mentions is probably disproportionately fighting age males. \n\nOne of the clearest indicators of this is the fact that terrorists killed during the Oct. 7 offensive do not seem to show up on the list. We know that between 500 and 2000 fighters died in \"67 Israel\" during the offensive, but the early list didn't \"jump\" at the start with fight-age male losses. \n\nThe incentive for \"the Resistance\" is obvious. They plan to claim victory/they fought off Israel after the war ends. It's the same reason they publish their absurdly fake Talley of Israeli casualties and the videos of RPG ambushes that don't show impact. They can't honestly admit to the Palastinian people that 2/3rds of their battalions have been smashed. \n\nIt's awkward for Israel because:\n\nIsrael actually has killed an absolute fuck ton of civilians. The ratio isn't quite as lopsided as the GMH Talley suggests. But 12k dead Palastinian children is a lot. The evidence that they've killed so many people is extremely well documented and the attempts to deny it or claim it's staged are really emberassing lies. \n\nThe thing is, Israel is probably aware of this. They do go around claiming the GMH is false, but they can't actually admit that the real reason why is that it's just incomplete. \n\nTechnically speaking, if Israel actually has killed 10k-15k resistance fighters and 25k-30k civilians, this isn't a *good* Soldier-Civilian death ratio. The US broadly achieved 2:1 in the seige of Mosul, so Israel with 1:1.5 - 1:3 still raises a bunch of uncomfortable questions. But, the fact they can't admit this leaves them open to the GMH charge of something ludicrous like 1:6 or worse. A 1:2 ratio is an exceedingly bloody war, but within defensible bounds. A 1:6 ratio is a much more credible genocide allegation. \n\nConclusion:\n\nWe're left with the Gaza Ministry number because it's the only Talley of the dead that's detailed and data driven. It's not a lie, but it should not be taken as a representative. It's still useful as an absolute floor of deaths. Still, I don't think people should be using it to actually discuss the death ratio in Gaza.", "time": 1711932842.0, "sentiment_scores": {"neg": 0.184, "neu": 0.738, "pos": 0.078, "compound": -1.0}}, {"title": "CMV: The UK has more in common with Northern Europe than Western Europe", "description": "It seems common to consider the UK as a Western European country in line with France, Germany etc, however I would argue that when it comes to classification, the UK should be considered with the same mindset as Northern European (ie the Nordics, the Baltics and possibly the Netherlands and Ireland). This is in part a geographical consideration, however I recognise the distinction between Northern, Western and Eastern Europe in that sense is fairly arbitrary. Instead, I would argue that the relation exists on wider levels of culture, economics and politics, such that in general it should be natural to consistently refer to this as a distinct group with the UK included. This BBC article (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35374822) does a good job at listing a number of these points, but to give a broad overview of my thinking:\n\nPolitically:\n- They are joined together in multiple political organisations built around this grouping, such as the Northern Futures Forum and the Joint Expeditionary Force\n- They tend have a relative history of Euroscepticism, or otherwise being distinct from the rest of the EU/not in it at all\n- Almost all of them operate using some variation of a Parliamentary system\n\nEconomically:\n- Their economic systems are all far more oriented towards knowledge and innovation than the rest of Europe\n- Their government services tend to operate in similar ways, such as in single payer models of healthcare and in spending on welfare services\n- They all tend to contribute large proportions of their income on foreign aid relative to other nations\n\nCulturally:\n- They all tend to be far more socially liberal than the rest of the world in outlook\n- A much greater emphasis is placed in their societies on speaking good English\n- In general, their culture tends to be very similar to the UK in humour, personality etc\n\nIf you want to go further, you could even point out things like the UK flag looking similar to the Nordic ones and many of them having royal families!\n\nAs far as I can see, the only major exceptions to this lie in size (economically and in terms of population, the UK is more similar to Germany, France and Italy), and history, with the UK having a far more significant global role. However, given the number of above similarities these factors don\u2019t seem to be playing an enormous role overall.\n\nHence, I would argue that the UK is a Northern European country, not a Western European country.

For this argument I\u2019m assuming normal family suburban homes. Not some giant compound that uses extreme amounts of energy. I understand that those may have nearer term break even points. \n\n\nMy point: When people make the case that solar \u201csaves them money\u201d. They do overly basic math. \n\nExample: I spent $20k on the system. My bill used to be $100/mo and now it\u2019s $0/mo. So I break even 200 months aka 16 years. \n\nWhat I feel like is unfairly left out of the equation is the opportunity cost of the $20k. I think it\u2019s fair to debate where that money would have been otherwise (I.e. not in solar panels), but for debate I think it\u2019s fair to assume that money would be in the S&amp;P500 or VTSAX or equivalent.

I believe a person\u2019s character is defined by their thoughts, urges, and actions, which in turn is just a product of two things: brain chemistry and external stimuli. Upon receiving an external stimulus (which could be outwardly physical like the five senses or mental like a thought or emotion), the brain produces an output, like a thought, urge, or action, and then rewires itself based on the perceived reward (how good/bad something feels, also based on neurochemistry). As a person grows, this brain chemistry and input-output relationship becomes progressively built upon and defines what a person will do, think, or feel at any given moment. The state a person ends up in is thus defined by their starting brain chemistry, the method of rewiring, (both genetic/nature) and the environment they are in (circumstantial/nurture). This is just my understanding from my limited knowledge of how the brain learns, with some concepts from reinforcement learning thrown in\u2014very open to believing this could be wrong. But in this framework there is only the illusion of control and not control itself.\n\nFor example, imagine you had infinite computing power and some incredible simulation tools that could create a computational learning agent that would interact with a dynamic world around it. You initialize like a thousand of these agents by putting them in different environments with different starting variables, and let them loose and observe (to be fair this is almost already a reality!) The programmers/observers would likely say that any behavior is not under any moral guidelines, and understand that an agent\u2019s output and action are just a product of the code/math, randomness, and the environment. To me, our DNA operates extremely similarly, with a similar conclusion to be drawn about our behavior. If a person commits first degree murder or another heinous crime, they had no control over whether they would have the thoughts to commit the crime, or whether they lacked the neural guardrails to prevent them from doing it. Less drastically, many don\u2019t view addiction as a moral failure, because it\u2019s just brain chemistry\u2014some are inevitably more susceptible than others. Likewise if someone is \u201cmorally good\u201d it can be argued that they were just lucky that the product of their brain chemistry and environment aligned with societal values.\n\nThings and actions can still be judged good or bad, but they are evaluated in the context of whether they help you or not and not in the context of mortality. Therefore someone who is selfless, kind, and honest is considered good because they are less likely to harm you, while those who take pleasure in hurting others, lying, and death are more likely to harm you and are therefore bad. When expanded to the societal level, this creates cultural and social norms and laws, which are just a product of the people living in it (what people view as good and bad based on that brain chemistry) rather than some moral absolute. People are punished not because it\u2019s fair or moral, but because of power from collective interest.\n\nSo in practice, I understand that this shouldn\u2019t change most of how we live our lives\u2014we still undeniably have the illusion of choice, and shouldn\u2019t just let go of all accountability of ourselves. People should still be punished, and order should still be held. However, if we want to \u201crationally\u201d maintain some construct of fairness, rather than viewing some people as good or bad, lesser or more, based on their character (those thoughts, urges, and actions), we have empathy by realizing everyone just is a person and a product of things out of their control. Rather than demonizing \u201cevil\u201d and casting them aside with 0 remorse, it\u2019s something we look at with pity in that they were dealt a life of pain and suffering, both in what they received and caused. It\u2019s reasonable to think \u201cI would rather have this person on this earth than that person to live with for a happier life\u201d but unreasonable to think \u201cI am better than this person because if I were in their exact circumstance and had their same experience I would pick the more socially acceptable option\u201d because according to this model, you really wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s basically impossible to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes as an exercise to think that that person should have taken a different action. Likewise, for people that are a stereotypical \u201csaint,\u201d that is the hand they were dealt. \n\nVery interested in hearing counterpoints from the scientific and philosophical angle, as admittedly it\u2019s the best model of humanity that I can think of (and I\u2019m not a philosopher so I probably can\u2019t think of a lot). Also admittedly, this probably does sound like a big religion influenced-\u201ceveryone deserves love\u201d idea, which I\u2019m sure has some criticism. Thanks everyone!\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses. In doing so I think I may have made an error in how I phrased the topic statement\u2014my premises are the same though. To avoid replying in a very long post to everyone interested in discussing, I\u2019ll reframe here:\n\nPremise 1: The universe (and therefore human life)is predetermined. If we scientifically and mathematically proved today that the universe was predetermined, I would say this finding would be unsurprising as it is the most likely conclusion based on what we know of the universe already. To change my view, this probably requires some sort of scientific argument.\n\nPremise 2: Knowing this is the way of the world will not change your life in any way, nor our legal or societal structure. You cannot effectively use the fact that the universe is predetermined to justify any decision that you\u2019re making. You still feel the same emotions, feel the same quality of unfairness and what is reasonable\u2014whether they are predetermined or not doesn\u2019t matter in how you live your life. To change my view, this requires you to accept the hypothetical that we found out that the universe is predetermined and nothing else, and that in some way, life for you is now a completely different paradigm to what you were doing before. To me, the experience is the same\u2014you can\u2019t actually do anything with it because you can just as easily say \u201cI was fated to do this\u201d and do it as you can say \u201cI was fated not to do this\u201d and do the other thing. For all intents and purposes you still have to live like you have choices, things can still be reasonable, and things can still seem fair.\n\nPremise 3: Assuming you accepted the first two premises, I would argue that hatred/idolization of people are not a rational way to think about people\u2014ie the premise of this person is just inherently bad or evil or good doesn\u2019t make any sense. Of course people can still feel them because they are biologically driven, like lust or excitement, but when I step back and reason about it, there is no logical argument for why you could sustain hatred/disgust for another person. The only thing that pops out is that some people are more beneficial/more disadvantageous to your experience than others. You can still have enemies and people that are antithetical to your experience, but at the end of the day they are only doing what they think is right just as you are\u2014in another set of initialization variables, you would have done the same thing as your enemy. Everyone is just moving forward the way and doing what they believe to be best in the way that their biological code dictates. True good and evil no longer exist\u2014just human suffering and the absence of it. To change my view, one probably has to accept that the first two premises are true, and argue that it is still reasonable to hate someone, or think that people are still inherently evil in a way that is separate from believing they are just more dangerous to you and society.", "time": 1711947340.0, "sentiment_scores": {"neg": 0.107, "neu": 0.765, "pos": 0.128, "compound": 0.9959}}, {"title": "META: Bi-Monthly Feedback Thread", "description": "As part of our commitment to improving CMV and ensuring it meets the needs of our community, we have bi-monthly feedback threads.
