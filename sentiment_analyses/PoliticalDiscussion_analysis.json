[{"title": "Are the anti-Biden Left equivalent to the Never-Trump Right?", "description": "Since the attack on Israel on Oct 7th of last year by Hamas and the forceful response to that terrorism by Israel, many on the Left have protested Biden and those Democrats who support Israel as unacceptable to the point where some say they won't vote for Biden in November. Similarly, in 2016, a group of conservative Republicans didn't like Trump because he didn't uphold conservative values or principles and vowed not to vote for him then and for many, ever again. They became Never-Trumpers. Some even decided to support Biden and left the GOP.\n\nDo you see a similar phenomenon happening to those who decry Biden's support for Israel and pledge not to vote for him for president? Will they become essentially Never-Biden liberals, where a noticeable few defect and even support Trump over Biden, just as some Never-Trumpers did? How would this development upend the presidential contest? What kind of visibility would these defections receive in the media?", "sentiment_scores": {"neg": 0.082, "neu": 0.813, "pos": 0.105, "compound": 0.5486}}, {"title": "Should natives have expanded rights in government?
